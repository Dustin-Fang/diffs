# UI Recreation Evaluation Rubric

## Overview
This rubric evaluates UI recreation quality, comparing LLM-generated Android UI against the original Figma design. Score: 0-300 (300 = perfect).

## Data Variation Considerations
**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT penalize differences due to mock data:
- Pricing Information: Different prices, costs, monetary values
- Dates and Times: Specific dates, times, temporal information  
- User Data: Names, addresses, phone numbers, personal information
- Product Information: Product names, descriptions, specifications
- Quantities and Numbers: Stock levels, ratings, counts, numerical data
- Status Information: Availability status, booking states, dynamic content
- Location Data: Addresses, coordinates, location-specific information
