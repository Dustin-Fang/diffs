### Detailed Breakdown
#### Text & Typography
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are perfectly replicated in the recreation. There are no missing or hallucinated text elements. |
| Text Content Accuracy | 10 | 10 | All text content, including the header greeting, form field placeholders, button text, and the details section, is an exact match between the source and the recreation. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font family used in the recreation is an exact match to the source image. All character shapes and typographic styles are consistent across both designs. |
| Font Size | 6 | 10 | The font size for the placeholder text in the input fields ("Location", "July 08 - July 15", "2 Guests") is smaller in the recreation. Additionally, the body text under the "DETAILS" heading is also noticeably smaller than in the source design. |
| Font Weight | 6 | 10 | The font weights in the recreation are consistently lighter than the source. This is most noticeable in the input field placeholders, the 'Search' button text, the 'DETAILS' heading, and the 'Read More' link, which all appear less bold than the original design. |
| Line Height & Letter Spacing | 4 | 10 | The letter spacing for the "DETAILS" heading is significantly tighter than in the source design. Furthermore, the line height in the main description paragraph is too compressed, making the text block appear denser than the original. |
| Text Alignment | 10 | 10 | The text alignment for all elements, including headings, paragraphs, and input fields, is a perfect match to the source image. No alignment discrepancies were found. |

#### Color & Fill
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Background Color | 10 | 10 | The background colors of all components, including the main screen, cards, buttons, and navigation bar, are a perfect match to the source design. No discrepancies were found in the color palette used. |
| Text Color | 10 | 10 | All text colors in the recreation, including the black header, grey body text, and white button text, perfectly match the source image. No discrepancies were found. |
| Accent & Icon Color | 10 | 10 | The accent teal color used for the search button, save banner, and active navigation icon is a perfect match. All other icon colors, including the inactive grey icons, the active white icon, and the yellow hand icon, are also accurately replicated. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source design's gradients and fills. The main background gradient and the gradient on the 'Save 50%' banner are identical to the original. All solid fills are also accurate. |

#### Sizing & Dimension
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Width Consistency | 10 | 10 | The widths of all components, including the search input fields, search button, and content card, are perfectly consistent with the source design. No discrepancies in element width were identified. |
| Element Height Consistency | 10 | 10 | A detailed comparison shows no differences in element heights. The input fields, search button, main content card, and bottom navigation bar in the recreation all have heights identical to the source design. |
| Icon/Asset Size | 7 | 10 | Most icons in the recreation are consistently smaller than in the source. This is noticeable across the notification bell, the search input fields, the guest counter, and the bottom navigation bar. The hand icon in the 'Save 50%' banner is also visibly smaller. |
| Border Width | 10 | 10 | All border widths, including those on the input fields, the main content card, and the bottom navigation bar, are accurately replicated from the source image. |

#### Spacing & Positioning
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element X-Axis Alignment | 9 | 10 | The "Hello, Sourany!" text alignment differs slightly. In the source, it is centered in the space between the profile picture and the notification icon. In the recreation, it appears to be centered relative to the screen width, shifting it slightly left compared to the source. |
| Element Y-Axis Alignment | 10 | 10 | All components are perfectly aligned on the vertical axis. Icons and text within input fields, header elements, and navigation bar icons all match the source's vertical alignment. No discrepancies were found. |
| Relative Ordering | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct visual order, perfectly matching the source design. Icons are correctly positioned before text labels, and titles are placed above their corresponding descriptions. No ordering discrepancies were found. |
| Inner Padding | 8 | 10 | The inner padding of the 'Save 50%' tag is incorrect; the text is positioned too high. Additionally, the padding between the icon and text in the 'Location' input field is slightly larger than in the source design. |
| Inter-Component Horizontal Spacing | 8 | 10 | The horizontal spacing is slightly wider in the recreation. This is noticeable between the 'Hello' text and the notification bell, and between the 'Guests' text and the stepper control. The gap before the 'Read More' link is also slightly larger. |
| Inter-Component Vertical Spacing | 7 | 10 | The vertical spacing between the search form fields and the 'Search' button is slightly larger. The gap between the 'Search' button and the main content card is also increased. Conversely, the space between the 'DETAILS' heading and its description text is smaller. |

#### Structure & Hierarchy
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Group Nesting | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly replicates the nesting and structure of all visual groups. The main card, containing the image, title, and description, is structured identically to the source. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | All overlapping elements, including the bottom navigation bar, the central floating action button, and the 'Save 50%' banner, are correctly stacked and layered, perfectly matching the source design. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The overall grid layout is perfectly preserved. The recreation maintains the 2-column header, the stacked single-column layout for the form and content card, and the 5-column structure of the bottom navigation bar without any deviations. |
| Label Hierarchy | 10 | 10 | The visual hierarchy is perfectly preserved. The font weights, sizes, and casing for the main heading, input labels, card heading ('DETAILS'), and body text are all identical to the source design, creating a perfect match. |
| Repeated Content Uniformity | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly maintains the visual uniformity of repeated elements. The three input fields and the bottom navigation icons have consistent structure, size, and spacing, matching the source design exactly. |
| Section Dividers/Separators | 6 | 10 | The recreation is missing the horizontal line separators between the input fields (Location, Date, and Guests) within the top search card. The vertical separator in the 'Guests' input and the main card-based separation are correctly implemented. |
| Placeholder & Fallback Content | 6 | 10 | The placeholder text in the input fields is present, but its styling is incorrect. The font weight in the recreation is noticeably lighter than the semi-bold weight used in the source design, making the text appear thinner and less prominent. |
| Overflow & Clipping | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles text overflow with truncation and a 'Read More' link. The clipping of the 'Save 50%' banner against the rounded corner of the image container is also identical to the source design. |

#### Styling & Effects
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Border Color | 10 | 10 | The border colors are a perfect match. The light grey borders on the input fields and the notification bell icon in the recreation are identical to those in the source image. |
| Border Radius | 10 | 10 | The border radii on all elements are perfectly replicated. This includes the main content card, the input fields, the search button, the image container, and the bottom navigation bar. No discrepancies were found in any of the rounded corners. |
| Iconography Match | 10 | 10 | All icons in the recreation perfectly match the source in both style (e.g., outlined vs. filled) and type. There are no discrepancies found across the entire interface. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 10 | 10 | The shadow and elevation effects are perfectly replicated. All shadows on cards, buttons, and the navigation bar precisely match the source in terms of color, blur, and offset, creating an identical sense of depth. |
