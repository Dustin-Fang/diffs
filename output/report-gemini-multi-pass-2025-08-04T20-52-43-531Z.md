### Detailed Breakdown
#### Text & Typography
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation. There are no missing or hallucinated text elements, resulting in a perfect match for this criterion. |
| Text Content Accuracy | 9 | 10 | The text content is almost a perfect match. However, the "Read More" link in the source uses a capital 'M', while the recreation uses a lowercase 'm' ("Read more"). |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font family used in the recreation is identical to the one in the source image. All letterforms and typographic characteristics are a perfect match across all text elements on the screen. |
| Font Size | 10 | 10 | All font sizes appear to be perfectly matched across all text elements, including headers, input fields, buttons, and body text. No discrepancies were found between the recreation and the source image. |
| Font Weight | 10 | 10 | All font weights, from the bold greeting and headings to the regular body text and placeholders, are accurately replicated from the source design. No discrepancies were found in the font weights used. |
| Line Height & Letter Spacing | 10 | 10 | Line height and letter spacing are a perfect match. The paragraph leading and the tracking on the 'DETAILS' title are accurately replicated from the source design, with no discernible differences. |
| Text Alignment | 10 | 10 | All text blocks in the recreation, including headings, body text, placeholders, and button labels, perfectly match the left-aligned or centered alignment seen in the source image. No discrepancies were found. |

#### Color & Fill
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Background Color | 10 | 10 | The background colors of all UI elements, including the main background, cards, buttons, and navigation bar, are a perfect match to the source design. No discrepancies were found in any component's background color. |
| Text Color | 10 | 10 | All text colors are a perfect match. The black header, gray body copy, and white text on buttons and banners are all accurately replicated from the source design. |
| Accent & Icon Color | 10 | 10 | The recreation is a perfect match. The primary teal accent color is accurate. All icon colors, including the various grays and the yellow highlights on the notification bell and "Save" banner, are identical to the source image. No discrepancies were found. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | All gradient fills are perfectly replicated. This includes the main background, the 'Save 50%' banner, and the active home icon in the navigation bar. Solid fills are also accurate. |

#### Sizing & Dimension
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Width Consistency | 9 | 10 | The container for the plus and minus buttons in the 'Guests' input field is slightly wider in the recreation. This causes the plus button to extend further to the right compared to the input fields above it, breaking the vertical alignment. |
| Element Height Consistency | 10 | 10 | The heights of all components, including the input fields, search button, content card, and bottom navigation bar, are perfectly consistent with the source design. No discrepancies were found. |
| Icon/Asset Size | 10 | 10 | All icons and image assets are sized correctly. This includes the profile picture, search field icons, the main image, and all icons within the bottom navigation bar. The recreation is a perfect match. |
| Border Width | 10 | 10 | All border widths, including those on the input fields, buttons, and main content cards, are accurately replicated from the source design. |

#### Spacing & Positioning
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element X-Axis Alignment | 10 | 10 | The horizontal alignment of all elements is a perfect match to the source design. The header text, form inputs, card content, and bottom navigation icons are all correctly centered or aligned to the left and right edges as specified in the source. |
| Element Y-Axis Alignment | 10 | 10 | All components demonstrate correct vertical alignment. Icons and text within the input fields are properly centered, and the header and navigation bar elements are also aligned correctly, matching the source design. |
| Relative Ordering | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct visual order, perfectly matching the source design. The relative positioning of icons, text, and buttons within each component is identical to the source. |
| Inner Padding | 10 | 10 | The inner padding across all components is a perfect match. This includes the text and icons within the input fields, the main search button, the content card, and the bottom navigation bar icons. |
| Inter-Component Horizontal Spacing | 9 | 10 | The horizontal spacing between the 'Guests' text and the minus/plus stepper control is slightly wider in the recreation. The stepper control is positioned a bit further to the right than in the source design. |
| Inter-Component Vertical Spacing | 7 | 10 | The vertical spacing between the 'Guests' input and the 'Search' button is slightly reduced. Additionally, the margin between the 'Search' button and the main content card below it is smaller, making the layout feel more vertically compressed than the source. |

#### Structure & Hierarchy
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Group Nesting | 10 | 10 | The visual groups are perfectly structured and nested. The main card correctly contains the image, the discount banner, the details title, and the description text, matching the source design's hierarchy and grouping exactly. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | All overlapping elements, including the 'Save 50%' banner and the bottom navigation bar with its elevated button, are correctly stacked. The layering of all components perfectly matches the source design, with no discrepancies found. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | There are no discrepancies. The recreation perfectly preserves the single-column layout and the horizontal/vertical arrangement of all elements, matching the source design's grid structure. |
| Label Hierarchy | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly preserves the visual hierarchy. The font weights, sizes, and capitalization for the main heading, the 'DETAILS' subheading, and the body text are identical to the source, maintaining the intended distinction and emphasis between all text elements. |
| Repeated Content Uniformity | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly maintains the uniform structure and spacing of the repeated input fields and the bottom navigation icons, matching the source design exactly in this regard. |
| Section Dividers/Separators | 10 | 10 | There are no discrepancies. The recreation perfectly replicates all section dividers and separators. The card-based layout, the vertical line in the 'Guests' input, and the 'DETAILS' section label are all present and correctly placed, matching the source design. |
| Placeholder & Fallback Content | 10 | 10 | The placeholder text for the 'Location', date, and 'Guests' input fields is present and styled identically to the source image. There are no discrepancies in font, color, or content. |
| Overflow & Clipping | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles text overflow with an ellipsis and a "Read More" link. The clipping of the image carousel and the "Save 50%" banner within their rounded containers also precisely matches the source design. |

#### Styling & Effects
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Border Color | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source design's border colors. The subtle, light grey borders on the input fields, the notification icon, and the vertical divider for the guest count are all accurately replicated. |
| Border Radius | 10 | 10 | All border radii, from the main content cards and input fields to the buttons and navigation elements, are accurately replicated from the source design. No discrepancies were found. |
| Iconography Match | 10 | 10 | All icons in the recreation perfectly match the source image in both style (e.g., outlined vs. filled) and type. The active state for the home icon is also correctly replicated. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 10 | 10 | The shadow and elevation effects are perfectly replicated. All shadows on components like the main card, search button, and bottom navigation bar match the source's color, blur, and offset, creating the correct sense of depth. |
