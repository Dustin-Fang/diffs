### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 12 | 15 | While the overall alignment is good, there are a few minor but noticeable vertical alignment discrepancies. <br/>1. In the header, the 'Hello, Sourany!' text is positioned higher than in the source. In the source, the text is vertically centered with the profile picture and notification icon.<br/>2. In the '2 Guests' input field, the minus and plus controls are positioned slightly too low; they are not perfectly vertically centered within the field as they are in the source.<br/>3. In the bottom navigation bar, the four icons (home, search, location, profile) are also positioned slightly too low within the main bar area, breaking the vertical centering seen in the source design. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct order and grouped correctly, perfectly matching the source design. For instance, the icons in the search form inputs (location, calendar, guests) are all correctly positioned before the text. The elements in the top bar, main card, and bottom navigation bar are also in the correct sequence relative to each other. |
| Element Size Consistency | 8 | 10 | While most components, including the input fields, the main content card, and the bottom navigation bar, have dimensions consistent with the source design, there is a noticeable discrepancy. The 'Search' button in the recreation is significantly smaller, being both shorter and narrower than the button in the source image. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly matches the source in terms of group nesting and hierarchy. All major visual groups—the header (avatar, greeting, notification), the search form (inputs, button), the main content card (image, title, text), and the bottom navigation bar—are structured and nested correctly. The internal hierarchy within each group, such as the title and description within the card, is also a perfect match. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source image in terms of z-index and layering. The main content card is correctly placed above the background, the details card is layered on top of the main card, the 'Save 50%' banner correctly overlaps the image, and the bottom navigation bar with its raised central button is correctly layered on top of all other content. There are no discrepancies in the stacking order of any elements. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the column and grid structure of the source design. All major layout components, including the two-column header (name vs. notification icon), the vertically stacked single-column form fields, the internal structure of the 'Guests' input row, and the five-column bottom navigation bar, are identical to the source. The overall single-column flow of the screen is also maintained without any deviations. |
| Padding Within Components | 7 | 10 | While the padding within most components like the input fields and bottom navigation icons is accurate, there are noticeable discrepancies in key buttons. The primary 'Search' button in the recreation has less vertical padding, making the text appear more cramped than in the source. Similarly, the '+' and '-' buttons for the guest counter have significantly less vertical padding, with the icons being too close to the top and bottom edges of their containers. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 8 | 15 | There are several inaccuracies in the vertical spacing between major components. The margins between the input fields in the search form are slightly larger than in the source. More significantly, the vertical gap between the 'Search' button and the content card below it is much larger in the recreation, which pushes the entire content card down. The spacing within the content card itself is more accurate, but the overall vertical rhythm of the page is not correctly replicated. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 12 | 20 | There are two significant color inaccuracies on key interactive elements. Firstly, the 'Search' button's color is incorrect; the source uses a vibrant teal, whereas the recreation uses a muted blue-grey. Secondly, the background color for the selected 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation is wrong; the source uses white, but the recreation uses a yellow/orange color. Most other colors, including the main background, text, and the gradient banner, are accurately matched. |
| Button States | 3 | 10 | There are significant discrepancies in the representation of button states. The primary 'Search' button in the source is a vibrant, active teal, indicating it's ready for interaction. In the recreation, this button is a muted, desaturated blue-grey, which visually communicates a disabled or inactive state. This is a critical failure in conveying the button's intended state. Additionally, the selected 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar has a noticeably different, more saturated color in the recreation compared to the source's more subtle gold. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font family used in the recreation is an exact match to the source image. All text elements, including headings, body text, and button labels, utilize the same sans-serif typeface with identical letterforms. |
| Font Size & Weight | 7 | 10 | While most font sizes are accurately replicated, there are noticeable discrepancies in font weight. The main heading "Hello, Sourany!" and the text within the "Search" button are both visibly thinner and less bold in the recreation compared to the source design. Other text elements, such as the input field placeholders and the details section, are matched correctly. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 8 | 10 | The horizontal alignment of all text elements (header, input fields, button text) is a perfect match to the source design. However, the line height in the main description paragraph is noticeably larger in the recreation than in the source. This increased vertical spacing between the lines of text is the primary deviation from the original design. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | The border styling in the recreation is a perfect match to the source. All elements, including the main card, input fields container, notification icon, details card, and bottom navigation bar, have the correct border width, color, and corner radius. The implementation is flawless. |
| Iconography & Assets | 8 | 10 | Most icons and assets are a perfect match to the source in terms of style (outlined vs. filled) and size. However, there is a notable discrepancy in the active 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar. The source design uses a white, filled icon on a colored circular background to indicate the active state. The recreation incorrectly uses a colored (yellow/orange) icon on a white circular background, which is a deviation from the established design language for active navigation items. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 4 | 10 | While shadows are present on most of the correct elements (like the main card, search button, and bottom navigation bar), their implementation is incorrect. The source design uses soft, wide, and diffuse shadows to create a strong sense of elevation and a gentle, layered feel. In the recreation, the shadows are consistently tighter, darker, and less blurred. This is most noticeable on the main content card and the floating navigation bar, which appear much flatter and less elevated than in the source image. |
| Gradient/Fills | 7 | 10 | While most gradients and fills are preserved correctly, including the main background gradient, the 'Save 50%' banner, and the active home icon, there is a significant error in the fill of the 'Search' button. The source image uses a vibrant teal fill for this primary call-to-action, whereas the recreation uses a muted, desaturated blue-grey, which is a major deviation from the intended design. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 20 | 20 | All text elements in the recreation are placed identically to the source image. This includes the main greeting, the text within the input fields ('Location', 'July 08 - July 15', '2 Guests'), the 'Search' button text, the 'DETAILS' title, and the description paragraph. The alignment and spacing for every piece of text are a perfect match. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation. This includes the header, search fields, button text, card details, and description. No text is missing or has been hallucinated. |
| Label Hierarchy | 8 | 10 | The fundamental label hierarchy (heading > subheading > body) is correctly preserved. The use of all-caps for the 'DETAILS' subheading and bolding for the 'Read More' link also matches the source. However, the main heading 'Hello, Sourany!' in the recreation has a slightly lighter font weight, reducing its visual dominance compared to the source. Additionally, the body text has slightly lower color contrast, making it less prominent than in the original design. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures, specifically the three input fields for 'Location', 'Date', and 'Guests', are perfectly uniform and match the source design. They maintain consistent height, corner radius, internal padding, icon alignment, and vertical spacing between each item, creating a visually cohesive list. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | The 'DETAILS' section title is perfectly placed with the correct alignment and spacing. The main content card, which serves as a visual separator, is also positioned correctly. All other visual dividers, such as the lines between input fields in the search form, are accurately replicated from the source design. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 7 | 10 | The placeholder text in the recreation has a noticeably lighter font weight compared to the source. Additionally, the horizontal spacing between the leading icons and the placeholder text (e.g., 'Location', 'July 08 - July 15') is slightly wider in the recreation than in the source design. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source design in all aspects of overflow handling. The text truncation in the 'DETAILS' section, ending with an ellipsis and a 'Read More' link, is identical. The intentional overflow of the 'Save 50%' banner from the image container and its subsequent clipping by the parent card's rounded corner are also replicated precisely. The implied vertical scroll of the main content area is handled in the same way as the source. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 8 | 15 | The recreation correctly identifies and places the key visual feedback elements, such as the 'Save 50%' banner, the active state of the 'Home' icon in the navigation bar, and the primary 'Search' call-to-action button. However, there is a significant discrepancy in the color palette used for these elements. The source image uses a vibrant, high-saturation teal and a bright, warm orange for its feedback states, creating a lively and attention-grabbing feel. In contrast, the recreation uses a muted, desaturated blue-grey and a duller yellow. This change in color significantly alters the visual weight and emotional tone of the feedback, making it less impactful and not visually aligned with the energetic expectation set by the source design. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 15 | 15 | The element alignment in the recreation is a perfect match to the source. All components are correctly aligned both vertically and horizontally. Key alignments, such as the vertical alignment of the header icons, the horizontal centering of the main title and rating, the vertical alignment of the category buttons, and the left alignment of the main content column (from the 'Hotels' button down to the 'Details' text), are flawlessly replicated. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct order and grouped correctly, perfectly matching the source design. This includes the header elements (back arrow, location, share, like), the main title and rating (number before star), the category tabs, the details section (heading before text), and the 'Continue' button (text before icon). |
| Element Size Consistency | 10 | 10 | All component dimensions, including the header image, category buttons, image cards, and the main 'Continue' button, are perfectly consistent with the source design. There are no discernible differences in the height or width of any element. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly replicates the nesting and hierarchical structure of the source design. All visual groups, including the header block (title, subtitle, rating), the tab navigation, the image gallery, the 'DETAILS' section with its text, and the final 'Continue' button, are structured and nested identically to the source. The relationships and visual hierarchy between these groups are flawlessly maintained. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source in terms of element stacking and layering. The main content card correctly sits on top of the background image, and all other elements are layered as expected without any z-index errors. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the column and grid structures from the source design. The 3-column layout for the category tabs and the 2-column layout for the image gallery are both replicated exactly, with consistent spacing and alignment matching the original. |
| Padding Within Components | 10 | 10 | The inner padding within all components is a perfect match to the source design. The horizontal and vertical padding for the text and icons inside the category buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), the rating chip, and the 'Continue' button are all accurately replicated. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 10 | 15 | While some inter-component spacing is accurate, such as the horizontal gaps between the category buttons and the gallery images, there are notable vertical spacing discrepancies. The most significant error is the vertical margin between the description text and the 'Continue' button, which is much smaller in the recreation. Additionally, the vertical space between the category buttons and the image gallery is slightly larger in the recreation than in the source design. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | All colors in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. This includes the main card background, the various text colors for headers and body copy, the accent colors on the 'Continue' button and rating star, and the colors of the category selection pills. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly replicates the button states shown in the source image. The 'selected' state for the "Hotels" button, with its distinct background and text color, is accurately reproduced. Similarly, the 'unselected' state for the "Foods" and "Activities" buttons, and the state of the primary "Continue" button, are all identical to the source design. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | A detailed comparison of all text elements, including the main heading 'BALI', the category tabs like 'Hotels', the 'DETAILS' section, the body copy, and the 'Continue' button, shows that the recreation uses the exact same font family as the source image. The letterforms, weights, and overall typographic style are perfectly matched. |
| Font Size & Weight | 10 | 10 | The font sizes and weights in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. The large, bold heading 'BALI', the smaller 'indonesia' text, the category tabs, the 'DETAILS' label, the body paragraph, the bold 'Read More' link, and the 'Continue' button text all accurately reflect the size and weight of their counterparts in the source design. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 8 | 10 | While the horizontal alignment of all text elements is correctly implemented (e.g., 'BALI' is centered, 'DETAILS' is left-aligned), there is a noticeable discrepancy in the line height. The line height for the main paragraph under the 'DETAILS' section is smaller in the recreation than in the source image. This makes the text block appear more vertically compressed and deviates from the specified spacing. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | The border styling is perfectly replicated. All elements, including the main content card, category buttons, image cards, and the 'Continue' button, have the correct border-radius. There are no visible borders in either design, which is consistent across both images. |
| Iconography & Assets | 10 | 10 | All icons and images in the recreation are a perfect match to the source. The header icons (back, share, heart) are correctly styled as outlined icons. The rating star is correctly filled. The arrow in the 'Continue' button is also a correct match. The main hero image and the two smaller card images are the exact same assets as in the source design. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 4 | 10 | While shadows are present on most of the correct elements, their implementation is consistently incorrect. The shadows in the recreation are universally darker, less blurred, and less subtle than the soft, diffuse shadows in the source design. This is noticeable on the main content card, the image cards, and the 'Continue' button. The most significant error is on the selected 'Hotels' button; the source uses a subtle inset shadow to create a 'pressed' effect, whereas the recreation incorrectly uses a standard drop shadow, making the button appear raised. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | All gradient fills and background colors are perfectly preserved. The solid color fills for the main content card, the selected 'Hotels' button, and the 'Continue' button are identical to the source. The subtle gradient overlay on the header image, which darkens the top to ensure status bar icon visibility, is also accurately replicated. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 20 | 20 | The placement of all text elements in the recreation is a perfect match to the source image. This includes the main title 'BALI' and subtitle 'indonesia', the text within the category tabs ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), the 'DETAILS' title and its corresponding description, and the 'Continue' button text. All horizontal and vertical alignments, as well as relative spacing, have been replicated with precision. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source design are present in the recreation. This includes the location name, country, rating, category tabs, details header, description paragraph, and the 'Continue' button text. No text is missing or has been hallucinated. |
| Label Hierarchy | 10 | 10 | The visual hierarchy of the labels is perfectly preserved. The main heading ('BALI'), its subheading ('indonesia'), the section header ('DETAILS'), the body text, and the emphasized 'Read More' link all maintain their respective font sizes, weights, and capitalization, creating an identical visual relationship between all text elements as seen in the source image. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures, which include the three category filter buttons ("Hotels", "Foods", "Activities") and the two image cards, are perfectly replicated. Both sets of repeated items are uniform in size, shape, corner radius, and spacing, matching the source design exactly. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | The placement of all section labels and visual separators is a perfect match to the source design. The main content card, which acts as the primary visual separator, is positioned correctly. The 'DETAILS' section title is also in the correct location, with accurate spacing relative to the elements above and below it. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The source design does not contain any placeholder text elements (like a search bar with 'Search...'). The recreation accurately reflects this by also not including any such elements. Therefore, it is a perfect match for this specific criterion. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles text overflow in the 'DETAILS' section. The text is clipped at the exact same point as the source design ('...in the pri...') and correctly includes the 'Read More' link, indicating a faithful implementation of the design's overflow constraints. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 15 | 15 | The visual feedback provided in the recreation, specifically the selected state of the 'Hotels' button, perfectly matches the source design. The colors, font weight, and overall styling for both selected and unselected states are identical, ensuring that user feedback is visually consistent with the original design. |

| Content & Information Architecture | 88 / 100 |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 4 | 15 | There are critical alignment and positioning errors in the hero section. Firstly, the vertical order of the main title block ('BALI', 'indonesia') and the rating element ('4.9' star) is incorrect; they have been swapped. Secondly, the horizontal alignment for both of these components has been changed from center-aligned in the source to left-aligned in the recreation. These two issues represent a fundamental deviation from the source design's layout and visual hierarchy. While other groups of elements (e.g., the category buttons, the image cards) are correctly aligned within their own sections, the errors in the most prominent part of the screen are severe. |
| Relative Positioning | 7 | 10 | The relative vertical positioning of the elements in the hero section is incorrect. In the source image, the order is Title ('BALI'), Subtitle ('indonesia'), and then the Rating ('4.9 ★'). In the recreation, the Rating has been moved above the Title and Subtitle, changing the intended visual hierarchy and grouping. |
| Element Size Consistency | 7 | 10 | While most components, including the category buttons, image gallery, and the 'Continue' button, have dimensions that are highly consistent with the source design, there are noticeable size discrepancies in the main title block. The 'BALI' title, the 'indonesia' subtitle, and the '4.9' rating badge are all rendered at a smaller size in the recreation, which alters the visual weight and hierarchy of this key screen area. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 11 | 15 | There is a significant discrepancy in the visual hierarchy of the main header group. In the source image, the location title "BALI" is the primary element, followed by the subtitle "indonesia" and then the rating "4.9 ★". In the recreation, the rating has been incorrectly moved above the main title, disrupting the intended hierarchy and visual flow. The nesting of all other groups, such as the category tabs, image gallery, and details section, is correct. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source image in terms of z-index and layering. The main content card correctly overlaps the background image, and all UI elements like the top icons, text, and buttons are correctly stacked on top of their respective backgrounds. There are no layering discrepancies. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the column and grid structures from the source image. The 3-column layout for the category buttons and the 2-column layout for the images are both replicated with accurate spacing and relative proportions. The overall single-column flow of the content is also identical. |
| Padding Within Components | 8 | 10 | While the padding within the main 'Continue' button and the '10+' image overlay is accurate, there are discrepancies in other components. The horizontal padding for the 'Hotels', 'Foods', and 'Activities' category buttons is noticeably smaller in the recreation than in the source. Similarly, the '4.9 ★' rating pill appears to have slightly less horizontal padding. These inconsistencies in inner spacing prevent a perfect score. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 7 | 15 | There are significant discrepancies in the inter-component spacing within the main header section. In the source image, the vertical order of elements is Title ('BALI'), Subtitle ('indonesia'), and then the Rating button. In the recreation, this order has been changed to Rating, Title, and then Subtitle. This fundamental change in layout results in completely inaccurate margins between these three components. Additionally, the entire group of elements has been shifted vertically, altering its spacing relative to the top of the screen and the content card below. However, the vertical spacing between the components inside the main white card (category buttons, image gallery, details text, and continue button) is largely accurate. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | All colors, including background, text, and accent colors, are a perfect match to the source image. The main card background, pill backgrounds (both selected and unselected states), various text shades, and the primary call-to-action button color are all replicated with complete accuracy. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly replicates the button states shown in the source design. The 'selected' state of the 'Hotels' button (darker background, black text) is visually distinct from the 'unselected' state of the 'Foods' and 'Activities' buttons (lighter background, grey text), exactly matching the source. The primary call-to-action button 'Continue' is also a perfect match. |
| Typography Family | 3 | 10 | The font families used in the recreation are different from the source design. The most noticeable discrepancy is in the main heading "BALI" and the "DETAILS" subheading; the source uses a font with a flat-topped 'A', while the recreation uses a font with a pointed 'A'. Other subtle differences in letterforms, such as character width and the shape of the letter 'o', confirm that a different sans-serif font family was used throughout the interface. |
| Font Size & Weight | 10 | 10 | The font sizes and weights in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. All text elements, from the large 'BALI' heading and the '10+' text to the smaller 'DETAILS' label and body copy, have been replicated with high fidelity. There are no discernible differences in either size or weight for any text on the screen. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 3 | 10 | There is a significant alignment error in the main header section. In the source image, the 'BALI', 'indonesia', and rating elements are all horizontally centered on the screen. In the recreation, these elements have been incorrectly left-aligned. Furthermore, the vertical order of the rating and the 'BALI' text has been swapped. While the text alignment within other components (like buttons and the details paragraph) is correct, the error in the main header is a major deviation from the source design. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | The border styling, which primarily consists of border-radius for various elements, is perfectly replicated. The main content card, the category buttons, the image cards, and the 'Continue' button all have corner radii that match the source image exactly. There are no visible borders (in terms of width or color) in either the source or the recreation, which is correct. |
| Iconography & Assets | 10 | 10 | All icons, including the top navigation icons (back, share, heart), the rating star, and the arrow in the 'Continue' button, are a perfect match to the source in terms of style (outlined vs. filled), stroke weight, and size. The images used are also consistent in style and application. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 9 | 10 | The recreation correctly implements shadows on all the same elements as the source: the main content card, the rating element, the two image cards, and the 'Continue' button. However, the shadows in the recreation are slightly less blurred and diffuse than in the source. The source shadows, particularly on the main content card, have a softer and more spread-out appearance, which is not perfectly replicated. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | All gradients and fills are perfectly replicated. This includes the subtle dark gradient at the top of the main background image, which ensures the legibility of the status bar icons, and the dark gradient overlay on the '10+' image card. The solid color fills for the buttons and the main content card are also an exact match. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 8 | 20 | There is a major text placement error in the hero section of the screen. The main title 'BALI' and its subtitle 'indonesia' have swapped vertical positions with the '4.9' rating element. In the source image, the title and subtitle are located above the rating. In the recreation, the rating has been moved above the title and subtitle. All other text elements on the screen appear to be placed correctly. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation. This includes the time, location name, rating, category tabs, image overlay text, details heading, description text, and the 'Continue' button text. No text is missing or has been hallucinated. |
| Label Hierarchy | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly preserves the visual hierarchy of the labels. The relative font sizes, weights, and casing for the main heading ("BALI"), subheading ("indonesia"), section heading ("DETAILS"), and body text are identical to the source, ensuring a clear and consistent information hierarchy. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures, specifically the category filter buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') and the two gallery images, are perfectly uniform and visually correct. The recreation accurately matches the source in terms of spacing, size, corner radius, and styling for all repeated elements. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | All section labels and visual separators are perfectly placed. The main content card, the category buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), and the 'DETAILS' section title are all positioned correctly, and the spacing that divides the sections is identical to the source design. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | There are no placeholder texts or text fallbacks visible in the source design. The recreation correctly reflects this by also not including any such elements. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source design in its handling of overflow. The text clipping in the 'DETAILS' section, complete with the '... Read More' link, is identical. The visual cue for an overflowing image gallery ('10+') is also replicated exactly. The main scrollable card appears to be correctly implemented, matching the source's layout and design constraints. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly replicates all visual feedback elements from the source design. The active state of the 'Hotels' button is visually distinct and matches the source. Other feedback elements like the rating display and the '10+' image overlay are also identical, ensuring that user feedback is aligned with the original design's expectations. |
