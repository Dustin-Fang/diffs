### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 12 | 15 | The "Hello, Sourany!" text is positioned lower than the vertical center of the user avatar, unlike in the source where they are perfectly aligned. The notification bell icon is also positioned slightly lower and is not vertically aligned with the user avatar and greeting text. Lastly, the minus and plus icons in the "Guests" input field are positioned slightly higher than the vertical center of the "2 Guests" text. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | The order and grouping of elements are perfectly replicated from the source design. The sequence of icons and text within the input fields (Location, Date, Guests) is correct. The order of icons in the bottom navigation bar is also identical to the source. |
| Element Size Consistency | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 13 | 15 | The vertical spacing between the image and the "DETAILS" title is larger in the recreation, which slightly weakens their grouping within the card. Similarly, the gap between the "DETAILS" title and the description text is wider, subtly reducing the hierarchical connection between the heading and its content. The search button's color is less prominent in the recreation, which reduces its visual weight as the final action of the form group. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | All overlapping elements in the recreation are stacked in the correct order, perfectly matching the source design. The bottom navigation bar correctly sits on top of the main content, and the 'Save 50%' banner is correctly layered over its parent image. The central floating button is also correctly positioned on top of the navigation bar. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 13 | 15 | The "Search" button in the recreation is wider than the input fields above it, unlike the source where their widths are nearly identical. The horizontal spacing within the "Guests" input row is altered, with the text being positioned closer to the stepper control in the recreation. The icons in the bottom navigation bar are positioned slightly lower in the recreation, appearing more vertically centered within the navigation bar's height than in the source. |
| Padding Within Components | 4 | 10 | The primary "Search" button in the recreation has significantly less vertical padding compared to the source design. The icons within the notification bell and the bottom navigation bar buttons (Home, Add) are larger, which reduces the padding around them inside their containers. The text and icon within the "Location" input field also have slightly less top and bottom padding. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 10 | 15 | The vertical margin between the 'Guests' input field and the 'Search' button is noticeably larger in the recreation. The space between the 'Search' button and the main content card below it has also been increased compared to the source. Additionally, the vertical gap between the header text ('Hello, Sourany!') and the first input field ('Location') is slightly wider in the recreation. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 13 | 20 | The primary 'Search' button's color is a muted blue-grey instead of the correct vibrant teal. The active 'Home' icon in the navigation bar uses a dull, brownish-yellow instead of the specified bright yellow. |
| Button States | 4 | 10 | The primary "Search" button's color is a muted, desaturated blue-grey, which fails to match the vibrant, active teal state shown in the source design. The selected "Home" icon in the bottom navigation bar is a lighter shade of yellow compared to the deeper orange-yellow in the source. The notification bell icon is a slightly darker shade of grey than the one in the original design. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font family used in the recreation is an exact match to the source image across all text elements, including headings, labels, and body copy. |
| Font Size & Weight | 6 | 10 | The font weight for the 'Search' button text is lighter in the recreation than in the source. The 'Read More' text is not bold in the recreation as it is in the source design. Additionally, the main body text under 'DETAILS' appears to have a slightly lighter font weight in the recreation. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 7 | 10 | The line height of the main description paragraph is larger in the recreation, causing the text to take up more vertical space than in the source. The vertical spacing between the "Hello, Sourany!" greeting and the "Location" input field is slightly wider in the recreation. While most text alignment is correct, the text within the "Search" button appears to be positioned slightly lower than in the source. |
| Border Styling | 7 | 10 | The active home icon in the recreation incorrectly features a prominent orange border that is not present in the source. Additionally, the border around the notification bell icon is slightly thicker and more pronounced than in the original design. Similarly, the border surrounding the '2 Guests' input field appears heavier in the recreation compared to the source. |
| Iconography & Assets | 9 | 10 | The filled 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar is a different asset, with the chimney on the right side in the recreation instead of the left as in the source. This icon also appears to be slightly smaller in the recreation compared to the source design. All other icons and assets are a perfect match in style and size. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 4 | 10 | The shadow on the central '+' button is much darker and less diffuse in the recreation than the soft shadow in the source. The bottom navigation bar's shadow is harsher and more prominent in the recreation, whereas the source features a much subtler effect. The selected 'Home' icon in the recreation incorrectly has a drop shadow, which is not present in the source design. |
| Gradient/Fills | 4 | 10 | The 'Search' button in the recreation uses a solid desaturated blue fill instead of the vibrant solid teal fill seen in the source. The gradient on the active 'Home' icon background is less saturated in the recreation, appearing more pale yellow than the vibrant orange-yellow gradient in the source. Additionally, the 'Save 50%' banner's gradient is slightly less vibrant and has a subtly different transition compared to the source design. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 20 | 20 | The placement of all text elements in the recreation, including the header, input labels, button text, and card details, is a pixel-perfect match to the source image. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation, with no missing or hallucinated text. |
| Label Hierarchy | 6 | 10 | The 'DETAILS' heading in the recreation has a lighter font weight compared to the bolder weight in the source. The body text below 'DETAILS' also appears to be a lighter font weight, which reduces the visual contrast with its heading. Additionally, the 'Read More' link is not bold in the recreation, failing to match the emphasis and visual hierarchy present in the source design. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 14 | 15 | The active home icon in the bottom navigation bar, a repeated item, is filled with yellow instead of the source's white color. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 9 | 10 | The "DETAILS" section title is positioned slightly higher in the recreation compared to the source. This reduces the vertical padding between the image card above and the title text. Consequently, the entire card containing the details section is shifted up by a few pixels. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The placeholder text for 'Location' and the text for the selected date and guest count are all perfectly styled and positioned, matching the source image in font color, weight, size, and alignment. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles the truncation of the description text, ending with an ellipsis and a 'Read More' link as shown in the source. The 'Save 50%' banner correctly overflows the image container, matching the source's shape and position precisely. Visual cues for the horizontally scrollable image carousel, such as the side chevrons, are also identical to the source design. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 5 | 15 | The active state feedback for the home icon in the bottom navigation is completely different, using a colored icon in the recreation versus a filled background in the source. The primary "Search" call-to-action button has a much more muted color in the recreation, providing weaker visual feedback than the vibrant source button. Additionally, the notification bell in the source provides feedback with a notification dot, which is missing in the recreation. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 15 | 15 | All components are perfectly aligned both vertically and horizontally, accurately matching the source design. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | The relative positioning and ordering of all elements in the recreation perfectly match the source design. The sequence of icons and text within components like the header, rating pill, and continue button is correct. The grouping of related elements, such as the category tabs and image gallery, is also identical to the source. |
| Element Size Consistency | 4 | 10 | The category pills for "Hotels", "Foods", and "Activities" are taller in the recreation than in the source design. The two image cards are noticeably taller in the recreation, altering the vertical proportions of that section. The "Continue" button at the bottom of the card is also taller in the recreation compared to the source. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly matches the source image regarding the nesting and hierarchy of all visual groups, with no discernible differences in structure. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The stacking order of all elements in the recreation is identical to the source design. The main content card correctly overlaps the background image. All header elements and the rating button are correctly layered above the background image, and are not incorrectly overlapped by the content card. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 13 | 15 | The horizontal gap, or gutter, between the two images in the grid is wider in the recreation compared to the source. Consequently, the images in the recreation are slightly narrower than those in the source design. The vertical spacing between the category buttons and the image grid is also slightly larger in the recreation. |
| Padding Within Components | 4 | 10 | The horizontal padding within the category filter buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') is significantly reduced in the recreation. The 'Continue' button also has much less horizontal padding, making the button appear narrower and more cramped than in the source design. Additionally, the padding within the '4.9 ★' rating pill is tighter, bringing the content closer to the component's edges. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 15 | 15 | The vertical spacing between the category buttons, the image grid, and the text content is a perfect match to the source. The horizontal spacing between the category buttons is also identical to the source design. The margins surrounding the 'Continue' button at the bottom of the card are replicated accurately. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | The background colors for the main content card, buttons, and rating pill are an exact match to the source. All text colors, from the main 'BALI' header to the body copy and button labels, are perfectly replicated. The accent colors, specifically the teal 'Continue' button and the yellow rating star, are also identical to the source design. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The selected state of the 'Hotels' button is perfectly replicated with the same background and text color as the source. The unselected states for the 'Foods' and 'Activities' buttons also match the source design precisely. The default state of the 'Continue' button is visually identical to the source, showing no discrepancies. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The recreation uses the exact same font families as the source image across all text elements. The headings, body copy, and button text all appear to be a perfect match. There are no discernible differences in the typography family. |
| Font Size & Weight | 10 | 10 | All font sizes and weights in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image, including the main heading, body copy, and button text. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 6 | 10 | The line height of the main description paragraph is larger in the recreation than in the source. The "Read More" text incorrectly wraps to a new line in the recreation, whereas it is on the same line in the source. The vertical spacing between the "DETAILS" heading and the description paragraph is also slightly larger in the recreation. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | The border radii on all components, including the main content card, buttons, and image placeholders, are identical to the source. The subtle border on the inactive category buttons is also a perfect match in color and width. No discrepancies were found in any border styling. |
| Iconography & Assets | 10 | 10 | All icons, including the navigation, rating, and button icons, are identical to the source in style and size. The main background image is a perfect match to the source asset. The two smaller images in the card section are also identical to the source. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 3 | 10 | The shadows on the two image cards and the 'Continue' button are significantly darker and less diffuse in the recreation compared to the soft, subtle shadows in the source. The shadow on the main content card in the recreation is also darker and has less spread than the wider, softer shadow in the source design. The unselected category buttons ('Foods', 'Activities') in the recreation lack the noticeable, gentle drop shadow present in the source, reducing their sense of elevation. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches all solid color fills on elements like the background, content cards, and buttons. The subtle dark gradient overlay at the top of the hero image is also an exact match to the source. There are no discernible differences in any gradients or fills. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 13 | 20 | The "Read More" text is incorrectly placed on a new line instead of being inline with the description text. The "DETAILS" title and the subsequent description paragraph are positioned lower, creating a larger vertical gap between them than in the source. Most text elements, including the main "BALI" title, the category tabs, and the "Continue" button text, are positioned slightly lower than their source counterparts. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are correctly present in the recreation, with no missing or hallucinated text. |
| Label Hierarchy | 8 | 10 | The "Read More" text lacks the bold font weight seen in the source, making it less distinct from the body text and diminishing its role as a clickable action. The body text itself appears to have a slightly lighter font weight than in the source. Lastly, the "DETAILS" heading is marginally less bold in the recreation, which slightly reduces its prominence relative to the body text. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 12 | 15 | The spacing between the category buttons is slightly wider in the recreation than in the source. The background color of the selected 'Hotels' button is lighter in the recreation. The corner radius of the two repeated image cards is smaller in the recreation. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 7 | 10 | The 'DETAILS' section title is positioned too high, with significantly less vertical spacing between it and the image cards above compared to the source. Consequently, the 'Read More' text is also positioned higher than in the original design. The 'Continue' button is also shifted upwards, reducing the space between it and the description text. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The text fallback in the details section, indicated by the ellipsis and the 'Read More' link, is styled and positioned identically to the source, representing a perfect match. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The text clipping under the "DETAILS" section, indicated by the ellipsis and the "Read More" link, is identical to the source. The main content card, which is the primary scrollable area, is positioned and shaped exactly like the source, implying the same overflow behavior. There are no other visible scrollable or clipped areas, and the implementation perfectly matches the design's constraints. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 15 | 15 | The recreation is a pixel-perfect match of the source image, meaning all visual feedback regions, such as the selected state of the 'Hotels' button and the styling of the 'Continue' call-to-action, are perfectly aligned with the design expectations. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 8 | 15 | The rating element is left-aligned in the recreation, whereas it is horizontally centered in the source. The vertical order of the header elements is incorrect, with the rating placed above the 'BALI' heading instead of below it. This incorrect placement also shifts the 'BALI' and 'indonesia' text block higher vertically compared to the source design. |
| Relative Positioning | 7 | 10 | The rating element is incorrectly placed above the main 'BALI' title, whereas in the source design it is positioned below the 'indonesia' subtitle. This changes the vertical stacking order of the entire text block in the hero section. The main title 'BALI' and the subtitle 'indonesia' are consequently pushed down relative to the rating. |
| Element Size Consistency | 5 | 10 | The main 'BALI' title and the 'indonesia' subtitle are significantly smaller in the recreation than in the source design. The rating pill is smaller in both height and width in the recreation. The 'Continue' button at the bottom is shorter in height in the recreation compared to the source design. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 7 | 15 | The rating element is incorrectly positioned above the main title group instead of below it, disrupting the original visual hierarchy. The main title and subtitle group is left-aligned instead of being centered as in the source design. These changes alter the nesting and visual relationship between the rating, title, and subtitle within the hero section. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 8 | 10 | The stacking order of the main title and the rating badge is inverted in the recreation; the rating badge is incorrectly placed above the "BALI" text, whereas it is below the title in the source image. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 13 | 15 | The main title block, including "BALI" and "Indonesia", is positioned lower in the recreation, which alters the vertical spacing within the header's grid. The star rating element is also shifted down and to the left, changing its alignment within the header's layout. The entire main content card is positioned slightly lower on the screen, modifying the overall vertical grid of the page. |
| Padding Within Components | 6 | 10 | The vertical padding within the top rating button is smaller in the recreation, making it appear less spacious. The category filter buttons also have reduced top and bottom padding, causing the text to be closer to the component's edges. Finally, the main 'Continue' button exhibits less vertical padding, resulting in a shorter appearance compared to the source. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 9 | 15 | The vertical space between the category buttons and the image grid is larger in the recreation than in the source. The margin between the image grid and the "DETAILS" heading is smaller in the recreation. The vertical gap between the description text block and the "Continue" button is noticeably smaller in the recreation. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | All background, text, and accent colors, including their respective opacities, are a perfect match to the source image. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The selected state of the 'Hotels' button is visually identical to the source, perfectly matching the background color and text style. The unselected states of the 'Foods' and 'Activities' buttons are also an exact match to the design. The primary 'Continue' action button is perfectly replicated with no visual differences. |
| Typography Family | 2 | 10 | The primary heading 'BALI' in the source uses a wide, geometric sans-serif font, but the recreation uses a noticeably narrower and more condensed font family. The font used for the category buttons like 'Hotels' is rounder and more spacious in the source image than in the recreation. This font discrepancy is also apparent in the 'DETAILS' header and the body text, where the recreation's font has a more compact character structure. |
| Font Size & Weight | 6 | 10 | The main heading "BALI" has a lighter font weight in the recreation compared to the bolder text in the source. The rating text "4.9" is significantly less bold in the recreation, reducing its visual prominence compared to the source. The text within the category buttons ("Hotels", "Foods", "Activities") is lighter in the recreation than the semi-bold text in the source design. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 3 | 10 | The main title "BALI" is left-aligned in the recreation instead of being center-aligned as shown in the source. The subtitle "indonesia" is also incorrectly left-aligned, whereas it should be centered below the main title. The rating element is left-aligned in the recreation but is centered in the source design. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | The border radius applied to all components, including the main container, buttons, and image cards, perfectly matches the source. The absence of a visible border stroke on all elements is also correctly replicated. There are no deviations in border styling between the recreation and the source. |
| Iconography & Assets | 4 | 10 | The back arrow icon in the recreation is filled, whereas the source uses a thin, outlined style. The star icon within the rating badge is noticeably smaller in the recreation than in the source. The share and heart icons in the top navigation bar appear to have a slightly heavier line weight in the recreation. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 3 | 10 | The rating badge is missing the subtle drop shadow that makes it pop from the background image in the source. The two smaller image cards within the main content area are also missing their drop shadows, making them look flat. Similarly, the "Continue" button lacks the drop shadow seen in the original design, reducing its sense of elevation. |
| Gradient/Fills | 2 | 10 | The dark gradient overlay at the top of the main image, intended to enhance status bar legibility, is completely missing in the recreation. The gradient on the "10+" image is present but is noticeably less intense and covers a smaller area than in the source. The recreation fails to preserve the primary gradient fill from the source design. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 5 | 20 | The main title "BALI" is left-aligned in the recreation instead of being centered as it is in the source. The "indonesia" subtitle is positioned below the main title in the recreation, whereas it should be above it. The "4.9 ★" rating is placed above the main title in the recreation, but it is located below it in the source design. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image, including the time, location names, ratings, category tabs, details section, and button text, are correctly present in the recreation. |
| Label Hierarchy | 4 | 10 | The main heading 'BALI' is positioned below the rating in the recreation, whereas it is the primary element in the source. The subheading 'indonesia' is left-aligned with the heading in the recreation, unlike the centered alignment in the source which created a different visual grouping. The rating '4.9' has been moved from a supporting position below the main heading to a primary position above it, disrupting the intended visual flow. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures, which include the three category buttons and the two image cards, are visually correct and uniform, perfectly matching the source design in spacing, size, and style. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 8 | 10 | The "DETAILS" section title is positioned slightly higher in the recreation, reducing the vertical space between it and the image cards above compared to the source design. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | There are no placeholder text elements present in the source design, so there is nothing to evaluate for this criterion. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The text clipping for the description, including the 'Read More' link, is an exact match to the source design. The overflow handling for the image gallery, shown by the '10+' overlay, is also perfectly replicated. The overall clipping of content within the main card is natural and consistent, correctly implying a scrollable area. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 8 | 15 | The rating pill, a key feedback element, is incorrectly positioned above the main "BALI" title instead of below it. Consequently, the "Indonesia" subtitle is also misplaced below the main title, whereas it should be above it. This reordering of the rating, title, and subtitle elements fundamentally changes the visual hierarchy and information flow compared to the source design. |
