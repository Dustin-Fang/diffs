### Detailed Breakdown
#### Text & Typography
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation. There are no missing or hallucinated text elements. |
| Text Content Accuracy | 10 | 10 | All text content in the recreation, including headers, labels, and descriptive text, is an exact match to the source design. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font family used in the recreation is an exact match to the source image across all text elements, including headings, labels, and body copy. |
| Font Size | 10 | 10 | Font sizes for all text elements, including the header, input fields, button, and card content, are a perfect match to the source design. No discrepancies were identified. |
| Font Weight | 8 | 10 | The font weights in the recreation are consistently a step lighter than the source. This is most noticeable in the "Hello, Sourany!" greeting and the "Read More" link, which appear less bold. The placeholder text in the input fields is also slightly thinner. |
| Line Height & Letter Spacing | 10 | 10 | The line height of the paragraph text and the letter spacing across all text elements, including the 'DETAILS' heading and body copy, are a perfect match to the source design. |
| Text Alignment | 10 | 10 | The text alignment for all elements in the recreation is a perfect match to the source. All headers, input fields, buttons, and body text maintain the correct left or center alignment as specified in the original design. |

#### Color & Fill
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Background Color | 10 | 10 | The background colors are perfectly replicated. This includes the main dark blue background, the light gray content card, the white search form, the darker bottom navigation bar, and the teal used for buttons. No discrepancies were found. |
| Text Color | 10 | 10 | All text colors in the recreation are a perfect match to the source. This includes the black headings, the grey body text, and the white text on colored backgrounds. No discrepancies in color or opacity were found. |
| Accent & Icon Color | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source's accent colors, including the main teal and the yellow highlight. All icon colors and their opacities are also identical, resulting in a flawless replication for this criterion. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | All gradient fills are perfectly replicated. This includes the main background, the 'Save 50%' banner, and the active home icon in the navigation bar. Solid fills are also accurate. |

#### Sizing & Dimension
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Width Consistency | 5 | 10 | The input fields for Location, Date, and Guests are all narrower than in the source design. Most notably, the "Search" button is significantly narrower, failing to align with the width of the input fields above it as it does in the source. |
| Element Height Consistency | 10 | 10 | The heights of all components, including the input fields, search button, content card, and bottom navigation bar, are perfectly consistent with the source design. No discrepancies were found. |
| Icon/Asset Size | 7 | 10 | The notification bell icon in the top right is slightly smaller in the recreation. More noticeably, all the icons in the bottom navigation bar, including the central plus icon, are smaller than their counterparts in the source image. |
| Border Width | 10 | 10 | All border widths are accurately replicated. This includes the thin borders on the input fields, the notification icon, and the vertical divider for the guest counter. The implementation is a perfect match to the source design. |

#### Spacing & Positioning
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element X-Axis Alignment | 8 | 10 | The "Hello, Sourany!" text is not centered horizontally. In the recreation, it is shifted to the left, whereas in the source, it is properly centered between the avatar and the notification bell. |
| Element Y-Axis Alignment | 10 | 10 | All components are perfectly aligned on the vertical axis. The header elements, input field icons and text, and bottom navigation icons are all correctly centered vertically, matching the source design precisely. No misalignments were detected. |
| Relative Ordering | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct visual order, perfectly matching the source design. There are no ordering discrepancies between the recreation and the source. |
| Inner Padding | 7 | 10 | The padding to the left of the icons in the 'Location', 'Date', and 'Guests' input fields is larger in the recreation. Additionally, the vertical padding for the 'Search' button text is slightly smaller, making the button appear shorter than in the source design. |
| Inter-Component Horizontal Spacing | 10 | 10 | The horizontal spacing between all components is a perfect match. This includes the header elements, the icons and text within the input fields, and the icons in the bottom navigation bar. No discrepancies were found. |
| Inter-Component Vertical Spacing | 10 | 10 | The vertical spacing between all components, including the header, search form elements, content card, and bottom navigation, is a perfect match to the source design. No discrepancies were found. |

#### Structure & Hierarchy
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Group Nesting | 10 | 10 | The visual groups are perfectly structured and nested. The main card correctly contains the image, the discount banner, the details title, and the description text, matching the source design's hierarchy and grouping exactly. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | All overlapping elements are stacked correctly. The floating navigation bar is layered above the main content card, the central '+' button is elevated above the navigation bar, and the 'Save 50%' banner correctly overlaps the image, matching the source perfectly. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the overall single-column layout for the main content blocks. It also accurately replicates the multi-column structures within components like the header, the 'Guests' input, and the bottom navigation bar. The vertical spacing between form elements is also consistent. |
| Label Hierarchy | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly preserves the visual hierarchy. The font weights, sizes, and styles for the main heading, the 'DETAILS' subheading, body text, and interactive elements like 'Read More' are all consistent with the source design. |
| Repeated Content Uniformity | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly maintains the uniform structure and spacing for the list of input fields (Location, Date, Guests) and the bottom navigation icons, matching the source design. No inconsistencies were found. |
| Section Dividers/Separators | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source. All card-based section dividers, the vertical line separator in the guest counter, and the 'DETAILS' section label are present and correctly placed. |
| Placeholder & Fallback Content | 7 | 10 | The placeholder text content is correct. However, the font weight for the text in all three input fields ("Location", "July 08 - July 15", "2 Guests") is noticeably lighter in the recreation compared to the bolder weight used in the source design. |
| Overflow & Clipping | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles text overflow with truncation and a 'Read More' link. The clipping of the 'Save 50%' banner against the rounded corner of the image container is also identical to the source design. |

#### Styling & Effects
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Border Color | 10 | 10 | The border colors in the recreation are a perfect match to the source. The subtle grey borders on the input fields, the notification icon, and the central navigation button are all accurately replicated. |
| Border Radius | 10 | 10 | The border radius for all elements, including the main card, input fields, buttons, and navigation bar, accurately matches the source design. No discrepancies were found. |
| Iconography Match | 10 | 10 | All icons in the recreation perfectly match the source in both style (e.g., outlined vs. filled) and type. There are no discernible differences in the iconography used throughout the user interface. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source in all aspects of shadow and elevation. The shadows on the main card, buttons, and navigation bar are identical in color, blur, and offset, creating the same sense of depth. |
