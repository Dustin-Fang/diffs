### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 12 | 15 | The overall alignment of major components is good, including the vertical stacking of the form fields and the horizontal distribution of the bottom navigation icons. However, there are a few key discrepancies. The primary issue is in the header, where the profile picture, 'Hello, Sourany!' text, and notification icon are not vertically aligned correctly; the text is positioned noticeably lower than in the source. A more minor issue exists in the '2 Guests' input, where the person icon, text, and plus/minus buttons do not share the same crisp horizontal centerline as seen in the original design. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct order and grouped accurately compared to the source image. For example, within each input field, the icon precedes the text. In the header, the avatar, greeting, and notification bell are in the correct sequence. The overall vertical stacking of components (header, search form, content card, navigation bar) is also perfectly replicated. |
| Element Size Consistency | 9 | 10 | The overall size consistency is very good. Most elements, including the input fields, the main image card, and the bottom navigation bar components, match the source design's dimensions accurately. However, there is a minor discrepancy in the 'Search' button, which is noticeably shorter in height in the recreation compared to the source. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly replicates the nesting and hierarchy of all visual groups. The header elements, the search form inputs and button, the main content card with its image, tag, title, and text, and the bottom navigation bar are all structured and grouped identically to the source image. There are no deviations in the logical organization of the UI elements. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering of all elements in the recreation perfectly matches the source design. The 'Save 50%' tag correctly sits on top of the image, the bottom navigation bar correctly overlaps the main content card, and the floating action button is correctly layered above both the navigation bar and the content card. There are no discrepancies in the Z-index. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the column and grid structure of the source design. The main components (header, search form, content card, navigation bar) are stacked vertically in the correct order. Within the search form, the input fields and the search button are correctly organized in a single-column layout with consistent vertical spacing. The elements within each input row (icon, text, controls) are also aligned correctly, maintaining the intended grid. |
| Padding Within Components | 7 | 10 | While most components, including the input fields and bottom navigation icons, have accurate internal padding, the main 'Search' button shows a noticeable discrepancy. The button in the recreation is vertically shorter than in the source, which reduces the top and bottom padding for the 'Search' text, making it appear more cramped than the original design. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 10 | 15 | The spacing between the individual input fields in the search form is accurately replicated. However, the vertical margins between the larger component blocks are consistently larger in the recreation than in the source. This includes the space between the header and the form, the form and the search button, the search button and the main content card, and most noticeably, the space between the content card and the bottom navigation bar. This cumulative increase in spacing alters the overall vertical rhythm and composition of the page. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 15 | 20 | The color matching is highly accurate for most of the UI, including the main background, card backgrounds, text shades, icon colors, and accent gradients. However, there is one major discrepancy: the 'Search' button. In the source image, this button uses the primary vibrant teal accent color (#29C5BE), consistent with other accents. In the recreation, it is a muted, desaturated blue-grey (#5C748C). This is a significant deviation for a primary call-to-action button, breaking the color scheme's consistency. |
| Button States | 4 | 10 | There are significant discrepancies in the visual representation of button states. The primary 'Search' button's color has been changed from a vibrant, active teal in the source to a muted, desaturated blue-gray in the recreation. This new color is commonly associated with a disabled state, which miscommunicates the button's availability and importance. Additionally, the 'selected' state of the 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar has a different background color; it's a more saturated orange-gold in the recreation compared to the paler yellow in the source design. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The typography family used in the recreation is a perfect match to the source image. A close comparison of individual character glyphs (such as the single-story 'a', the open-tailed 'g', and the shape of the 'S') across all text elements confirms that the correct font family has been used. |
| Font Size & Weight | 7 | 10 | While most text elements match the source in size and weight, the body text under the 'DETAILS' heading is noticeably smaller in the recreation. The associated 'Read More' link is also smaller than in the source image, which is a clear deviation from the design. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 10 | 10 | All text elements, from the main heading "Hello, Sourany!" to the input field text, button text, and the description paragraph, are perfectly aligned as shown in the source image. The line height and spacing within the multiline description text are also identical to the source. There are no deviations in text alignment or spacing. |
| Border Styling | 3 | 10 | The recreation fails to accurately replicate the border styling from the source. While the border-radius on most elements appears correct, several key components are entirely missing their borders. Specifically, the input fields for 'Location', 'Date', and 'Guests', as well as the notification bell icon container, all lack the light gray border present in the source image. The active 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation is also missing its defined border. |
| Iconography & Assets | 7 | 10 | While most of the icons and assets are a perfect match to the source, there is a significant discrepancy in the active 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar. The source image shows a white, filled home icon on a solid teal circular background. The recreation incorrectly uses a yellow/orange filled icon on a white circular background, failing to match the style and color of this key navigation element. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 6 | 10 | The recreation correctly identifies most elements that require a shadow, but the implementation is inconsistent with the source. The shadows in the recreation are generally harsher, darker, and less diffuse than the soft, widely spread shadows in the source design. This results in a less polished look. For example, the shadows on the main card and the bottom navigation bar are noticeably less soft and spread out. Additionally, the subtle shadow on the notification bell icon's container is missing in the recreation. |
| Gradient/Fills | 6 | 10 | The recreation successfully preserves the more complex gradients, such as the one on the "Save 50%" tag and the subtle gradient on the active "Home" navigation icon. However, it fails to match the solid fill color of the primary call-to-action "Search" button. The source image uses a vibrant teal color, while the recreation uses a significantly different, muted blue-grey color. This is a major deviation for a prominent element. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 13 | 20 | While the overall placement is close, there are several minor but consistent inaccuracies. The main greeting 'Hello, Sourany!' is shifted slightly up and to the left. The text inside all three input fields ('Location', 'July 08 - July 15', '2 Guests') and the 'Search' button is positioned slightly lower than in the source. The 'DETAILS' title and its following paragraph are also shifted downwards, creating a larger gap below the image card. Finally, the 'Save 50%' text is misplaced slightly high and to the left within its banner. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source design are present in the recreation. This includes the header text, input field placeholders, button text, and the descriptive text in the card. No text is missing or has been added. |
| Label Hierarchy | 6 | 10 | The visual hierarchy of the labels is not perfectly preserved. The main heading, "Hello, Sourany!", has a noticeably lighter font-weight in the recreation, diminishing its top-level prominence compared to the bold source version. Additionally, the body text paragraph below "DETAILS" appears slightly bolder in the recreation, which reduces the visual contrast and distinction between the body text and the bolded "Read More" link, thereby flattening the intended hierarchy in that section. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures in the recreation are a perfect match to the source design. Both the list of form fields (Location, Date, Guests) and the icons in the bottom navigation bar maintain uniform spacing, alignment, and internal styling, exactly as shown in the source image. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | The section title 'DETAILS' is correctly positioned and styled. Additionally, the card elements that serve as visual dividers for the search form, the details section, and the bottom navigation bar are all accurately placed, perfectly matching the source design. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The placeholder text in the input fields ("Location", "July 08 - July 15", and "2 Guests") is perfectly replicated. The font, size, color, and positioning of the text within each field are identical to the source image, with no discernible differences. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles text overflow in the 'DETAILS' section. The text is truncated at the exact same point as the source, correctly using an ellipsis and a 'Read More' link to indicate more content is available. Visual cues for other scrollable elements, like the image carousel, are also identical to the source design. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 9 | 15 | The recreation successfully replicates several visual feedback elements, including the active state of the home icon in the bottom navigation, the notification indicator on the bell icon, and the promotional banner on the image card. However, there is a critical discrepancy in the primary call-to-action "Search" button. The source image uses a vibrant, high-contrast teal color, providing strong feedback about the button's active state and importance. The recreation uses a muted, low-contrast greyish-blue color, which fundamentally changes the visual feedback and hierarchy, potentially making the button appear less important or even disabled. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 15 | 15 | The recreation is a pixel-perfect match to the source image concerning element alignment. All components, including the header elements, category tabs, image cards, text blocks, and the button, are perfectly aligned both vertically and horizontally, exactly as shown in the source design. There are no deviations in alignment. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct order and grouping, perfectly matching the source design. The sequence of icons in the header, the order of the category tabs, the arrangement of text elements like 'BALI' above 'indonesia', and the relative position of the text and icon within the 'Continue' button are all identical to the source. |
| Element Size Consistency | 10 | 10 | The recreation is a pixel-perfect match to the source design. All component dimensions, including the header elements, category selection buttons, image cards, and the final call-to-action button, are identical in height and width to the source image. There are no discernible differences in size for any element. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly mirrors the source image in terms of group nesting and hierarchy. All visual groups, such as the main content card, the category selection tabs, the image cards, and the 'Details' section, are structured and nested correctly. The parent-child relationships and the order of sibling elements are identical to the source design. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering of elements in the recreation is a perfect match to the source image. The main content card correctly sits on top of the background header image, and all floating elements like the header icons and rating pill are stacked correctly on top of the image. There are no discrepancies in the z-index of any components. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The column and grid structure of the recreation is a perfect match to the source. The three horizontally-aligned category buttons are correctly spaced. The two-column grid for the image cards is accurately implemented with the correct gutter size. The overall single-column layout for the content within the card is also preserved. |
| Padding Within Components | 10 | 10 | The internal padding of all components is a perfect match to the source image. This includes the rating pill (4.9 ★), the category buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), the '10+' overlay on the image card, and the main 'Continue' button. In every case, the spacing between the content (text and icons) and the component's border is identical to the source. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 15 | 15 | The inter-component spacing in the recreation is a pixel-perfect match to the source design. All vertical and horizontal margins between distinct elements—such as the space between the category filter buttons and the image cards, the space between the image cards and the 'DETAILS' heading, and the space between the description text and the 'Continue' button—are identical to the source. |

| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | The color matching in the recreation is flawless. A detailed comparison using a color picker tool confirms that all colors—from the main dark blue-grey background panel to the various text shades, button states (active, inactive, primary), and accent colors like the rating star—are identical to the source image. The opacity of elements like the rating badge also appears to be perfectly replicated. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly replicates the button states shown in the source design. The 'selected' state of the 'Hotels' button, with its darker background and white text, is accurately implemented. The 'unselected' states for the 'Foods' and 'Activities' buttons, with their white backgrounds and dark text, are also a perfect match. All visible states are visually distinct and identical to the source. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font families used in the recreation are a perfect match to the source design. All text elements, from the main heading 'BALI' to the body text under 'DETAILS' and the button labels, utilize the same sans-serif typeface with no discernible differences in the letterforms. |
| Font Size & Weight | 10 | 10 | The font sizes and weights in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. All text elements, from the large 'BALI' heading to the smaller 'indonesia' subtitle, the 'DETAILS' section, the body copy, and the button text, have been replicated with complete accuracy. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 6 | 10 | The overall text alignment is mostly correct, with headers and button text being properly centered or left-aligned. However, there are two key discrepancies. Firstly, the 'Read More' text in the details section is incorrectly placed on a new line in the recreation, whereas it should be inline with the preceding paragraph text as shown in the source. This significantly alters the spacing and layout of the text block. Secondly, the vertical spacing between the main title 'BALI' and the subtitle 'indonesia' is noticeably larger in the recreation compared to the source design. |
| Border Styling | 9 | 10 | The border radius for all elements, including the main content card, the image cards, and all buttons, is replicated accurately. However, there is a very subtle discrepancy. In the source image, the inactive category buttons ('Foods' and 'Activities') have a faint, light-grey border. In the recreation, this border is missing, causing the buttons to blend into the white background card more than intended. |
| Iconography & Assets | 10 | 10 | All icons and image assets in the recreation are a perfect match to the source design. The header icons (back arrow, share, heart) correctly use an outlined style with the appropriate stroke weight. The star icon for the rating is correctly filled. The arrow icon in the 'Continue' button is also a perfect match. All photographic assets are identical to the source. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 7 | 10 | Shadows are present on all the correct elements, including the main content card, the two smaller image cards, and the 'Continue' button. However, the quality of the shadow on the inner elements (the two image cards and the 'Continue' button) is not a perfect match. In the source image, these shadows are very soft and subtle. In the recreation, the shadows are noticeably darker and have a harder edge, making the elevation effect more pronounced than intended in the original design. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly preserves all gradients and fills. The subtle linear gradient on the 'Continue' button is flawlessly matched, and all other solid color fills (backgrounds, buttons) are identical to the source design. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 17 | 20 | The text placement is very close to the source, but there are minor discrepancies in vertical spacing. The gap between the 'indonesia' subtitle and the main 'BALI' title is slightly larger in the recreation. Similarly, the space between the 'DETAILS' header and the descriptive paragraph below it is also slightly increased. All other text elements appear to be placed correctly within their respective components. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source design, including the time, location, headings, button labels, ratings, and body text, are correctly present in the recreation. No text is missing or has been added. |
| Label Hierarchy | 10 | 10 | The visual hierarchy of the labels in the recreation is a perfect match to the source image. The font sizes, weights, and styles for the main heading ("BALI"), its subheading ("indonesia"), the section title ("DETAILS"), and the body text are all preserved, maintaining the intended order of importance and readability. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures, specifically the three category filter buttons and the two image cards, are perfectly replicated from the source image. They maintain uniform size, spacing, corner radii, and internal styling, resulting in a flawless match for this criterion. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | All section titles and visual dividers are perfectly replicated. The main content card is positioned correctly, and the 'DETAILS' section title is in the right place with the correct capitalization and styling. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The source design does not contain any placeholder text elements (e.g., in a search bar or input field). The recreation accurately reflects this by also not including any, resulting in a perfect match for this specific criterion. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles all visible overflow and clipping as shown in the source design. The horizontal scrollable list is clipped correctly, and the text truncation in the details section is an exact match. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 15 | 15 | The visual feedback for the selected state of the 'Hotels' tab is perfectly replicated. The background color, text color, and overall appearance are identical to the source image, clearly indicating the active category. The unselected states of the 'Foods' and 'Activities' tabs are also a perfect match, providing clear and consistent feedback to the user. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 9 | 15 | While most elements within the main content card are correctly aligned (e.g., the category buttons, the image previews, and the 'Details' section), there is a critical alignment error in the hero image section. In the source design, the location name 'BALI' and 'indonesia' are positioned above the star rating. In the recreation, this vertical alignment is inverted, with the star rating incorrectly placed above the location name. This fundamentally changes the layout and hierarchy of the most prominent information on the screen. |
| Relative Positioning | 7 | 10 | The relative positioning of most elements is correct. However, there is a significant error in the main content area overlaying the background image. In the source image, the location title "BALI" and subtitle "Indonesia" are positioned above the rating chip. In the recreation, this vertical order is inverted, with the rating chip appearing above the main title, which alters the intended visual hierarchy. |
| Element Size Consistency | 6 | 10 | There are several inconsistencies in element dimensions. The most significant is the '4.9' star rating pill, which is noticeably smaller in the recreation than in the source design. Additionally, the 'Hotels', 'Foods', and 'Activities' filter buttons are all slightly smaller in the recreation. The two image cards are also marginally shorter in height. While other elements like the header text and 'Continue' button are sized correctly, these discrepancies are notable. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 7 | 15 | The recreation correctly structures most of the content groups within the main card, such as the details section and the image previews. However, there is a critical error in the hierarchy and nesting of the main title group overlaid on the header image. In the source design, the hierarchy is clearly 'BALI' (title), then 'Indonesia' (subtitle), then the '4.9' star rating. This logically groups the location information first, followed by its rating. The recreation incorrectly places the '4.9' star rating pill *above* the 'BALI' title, breaking the intended visual hierarchy and logical structure of this primary information group. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering of elements in the recreation is a perfect match to the source design. All overlapping components, including the main content card over the hero image, the '10+' text on top of its image card, and the header elements over the hero image, are correctly stacked with the proper z-index. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the column and grid structure of the source design. The main single-column layout is correct, the three-element horizontal layout for the filter buttons is accurate, and the two-column grid for the image gallery is implemented with the correct structure and spacing between the columns. |
| Padding Within Components | 7 | 10 | The vertical padding within most components is accurately replicated. However, there are consistent minor discrepancies in the horizontal padding. The rating pill ('4.9 ★'), the category pills ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), and especially the 'Continue' button all have less horizontal padding than the source image, making them appear horizontally compressed. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 4 | 15 | The most significant discrepancy is in the hero section, where the rating pill and the main title/subtitle ('BALI', 'Indonesia') have been swapped vertically. This fundamentally changes the layout and the spacing between these components and the content below. Additionally, nearly all vertical margins within the main content card are inaccurate. The space between the 'DETAILS' heading and the description paragraph is too large, while the space between the description and the 'Continue' button is too small. Other vertical gaps, such as between the category pills and the image grid, are also different from the source design. The only correctly implemented spacing is the horizontal gaps between the category pills and the two image cards. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | All colors in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. This includes the main background, the content card background, the active and inactive tab colors, all text colors (headings, body text, button text), the primary accent color of the 'Continue' button, and the yellow of the star icon. There are no deviations in color or opacity. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly replicates the button states visible in the source design. The distinction between the selected state ('Hotels' button with a grey background and black text) and the unselected states ('Foods' and 'Activities' buttons with a white background and grey text) is accurately implemented. The primary 'Continue' button also matches the source perfectly. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font family used in the recreation is a perfect match to the source image across all text elements, including headers, body copy, and button labels. There are no instances of incorrect font usage or fallback fonts. |
| Font Size & Weight | 4 | 10 | The recreation consistently fails to match the font sizes and weights from the source design. Nearly every text element, including the main "BALI" heading, the "DETAILS" subheading, the tab labels ("Hotels", "Foods"), and the "Continue" button text, is rendered with a noticeably smaller font size and a lighter font weight. While the relative hierarchy is somewhat preserved (e.g., headings are still bolder than body text), the overall typographic scale is incorrect, resulting in a design that lacks the same visual impact and emphasis as the source. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 4 | 10 | While most of the text elements like the category tabs ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), the 'DETAILS' heading, and the description paragraph are correctly aligned, there is a major alignment discrepancy in the main hero section. In the source image, the 'BALI' title, 'Indonesia' subtitle, and the '4.9' rating chip are all center-aligned. In the recreation, all three of these prominent elements have been incorrectly left-aligned, which significantly changes the layout and visual balance of the screen. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | All border radii on elements such as the main content card, buttons, and image thumbnails are accurately replicated. There are no discrepancies in border width or color, as the elements correctly lack visible border strokes, matching the source design. |
| Iconography & Assets | 10 | 10 | All icons and image assets in the recreation are a perfect match to the source design. The style of the icons (e.g., outlined navigation icons, filled star icon) is correctly implemented, and their sizes are accurate. The images used for the hero section and the smaller cards are the correct assets. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 10 | 10 | The shadow and elevation effects in the recreation are a perfect match to the source design. The subtle drop shadows on the main content card, the rating pill, the two image cards, and the 'Continue' button are all present and correctly implemented, matching the source in terms of softness, offset, and opacity. The recreation successfully captures the intended depth and layering of the UI. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | All gradient and solid fills have been perfectly replicated. The linear gradient on the 'Continue' button is an exact match to the source. The dark semi-transparent fill on the '10+' image card is also correctly implemented, as are the solid color fills on the other buttons and the main content card. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 13 | 20 | While most text elements are placed correctly, there is a significant discrepancy in the hero section. In the source image, the main title 'BALI', the subtitle 'indonesia', and the rating '4.9' are all horizontally centered on the screen. In the recreation, these elements have been shifted to the left and are left-aligned with each other, which is a major deviation from the source design's text placement. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation. This includes the time, main heading ('BALI'), subheading ('indonesia'), rating ('4.9'), tab labels ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), image overlay text ('10+'), section title ('DETAILS'), description text, and the button text ('Continue'). No text has been added or omitted. |
| Label Hierarchy | 8 | 10 | The overall label hierarchy is well-maintained, with section titles, body text, and button text correctly differentiated. However, there is a noticeable discrepancy in the main heading. The font weight for "BALI" in the recreation is significantly lighter than in the source image, which reduces its visual dominance. The subheading "indonesia" also appears slightly lighter. While the relationship between the heading and subheading is preserved, their collective impact at the top of the hierarchy is diminished compared to the source design. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures, specifically the filter buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') and the gallery image cards, are perfectly replicated. They maintain consistent sizing, spacing, alignment, and styling, matching the source image exactly. Both sets of repeated items are visually correct and uniform. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 6 | 10 | The primary visual separator, the main white content card, is positioned noticeably lower in the recreation than in the source. This is likely due to the header text ('BALI') being placed lower, which pushes the entire card down. Consequently, the category tabs ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') are also lower than they should be. Furthermore, the 'DETAILS' section title is placed too close to the image cards above it; the vertical spacing is significantly less than in the source design. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The source design does not feature any placeholder text (e.g., in a search bar or input field). The recreation correctly reflects this by not including any such elements. Therefore, it is a perfect match for this specific criterion. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles text overflow in the details section. The text is truncated with an ellipsis at the exact same point as the source, and the 'Read More' link is implemented identically. The '10+' overlay on the second image, indicating more content, is also a perfect match. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 8 | 15 | The visual feedback for the selected category tab ('Hotels') is accurately replicated in terms of color, shape, and typography. However, there is a major discrepancy in the placement of the user rating feedback element ('4.9 ★'). In the source design, this element is centered below the main 'BALI' heading. In the recreation, it has been moved to the top left corner, above the heading. This significantly alters the layout and visual hierarchy of the feedback components in the header area, deviating from the source's design expectations. |
