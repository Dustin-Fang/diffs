### Detailed Breakdown
#### Text & Typography
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Content Presence | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Text Content Accuracy | 10 | 10 | All text content, including headers, labels, placeholders, and body text, is an exact match to the source design. There are no discrepancies. |
| Typography Family | 2 | 10 | The recreation uses an incorrect font family. The source font features a double-story 'a' (e.g., in "Location") and an open-loop 'g'. The recreation uses a font with a single-story 'a' and a closed-loop 'g', which is a significant typographic deviation. |
| Font Size | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Font Weight | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Line Height & Letter Spacing | 8 | 10 | The line height in the main description paragraph is slightly smaller in the recreation compared to the source. This makes the block of text appear more vertically compressed. The letter spacing on most other elements appears to be accurate. |
| Text Alignment | 10 | 10 | All text blocks in the recreation correctly match the alignment (left, center, right) of the source image. No discrepancies were found in the alignment of any text element. |

#### Color & Fill

| Background Color | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Text Color | 10 | 10 | All text colors, from headings and input fields to body copy and button labels, are accurately replicated. No discrepancies were found in color or opacity for any text element. |
| Accent & Icon Color | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Gradient/Fills | 7 | 10 | The fill color of the main 'Search' button is incorrect. The source image uses a vibrant teal, whereas the recreation uses a muted, darker blue-grey. The other gradients on the page are accurately replicated. |

#### Sizing & Dimension
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Width Consistency | 4 | 10 | The 'Search' button's width is incorrect. In the source design, the button is full-width, matching the input fields above it. In the recreation, the button is significantly narrower, breaking the consistent width established by the form elements. |
| Element Height Consistency | 9 | 10 | The 'Search' button in the recreation is slightly shorter than in the source design. The vertical padding within the button appears to be reduced, making it less tall. Other elements, like the input fields, are consistent. |
| Icon/Asset Size | 7 | 10 | The icons in the recreation are consistently smaller than in the source. This is most noticeable with the notification bell, the hand icon in the banner, and all of the icons in the bottom navigation bar. |
| Border Width | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |

#### Spacing & Positioning
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element X-Axis Alignment | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Element Y-Axis Alignment | 10 | 10 | There are no discernible differences in vertical alignment. All components, including header elements, form field contents, and bottom navigation icons, are correctly centered and aligned on the Y-axis, perfectly matching the source design. |
| Relative Ordering | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct visual order. The sequence of components and the internal ordering of elements within them (e.g., icon before text, title above description) perfectly match the source design. |
| Inner Padding | 7 | 10 | The vertical padding within the 'Search' button is significantly reduced, making the button appear shorter than in the source. The padding around the 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar is also smaller, making its container tighter around the icon. |
| Inter-Component Horizontal Spacing | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Inter-Component Vertical Spacing | 6 | 10 | The vertical spacing around the 'Search' button is inaccurate. The margin above the button is too large, while the margin below it, separating it from the main content card, is too small. This disrupts the intended vertical rhythm of the layout. |

#### Structure & Hierarchy
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Group Nesting | 10 | 10 | All visual groups, including the header, search form, main content card, and bottom navigation, are correctly nested and structured. The hierarchy and relationships between parent and child elements perfectly match the source design. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Column/Grid Structure | 13 | 15 | The overall single-column layout is preserved. However, the horizontal spacing within the "Guests" input row is altered; the recreation spaces elements evenly, unlike the source which groups the plus/minus buttons. Vertical spacing between some form elements also differs slightly from the source design. |
| Label Hierarchy | 10 | 10 | The visual hierarchy is perfectly preserved. The font sizes, weights, and casing for the main heading, the 'DETAILS' subheading, and the body text are all consistent with the source design, maintaining the intended visual order and emphasis. |
| Repeated Content Uniformity | 0 | 15 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Section Dividers/Separators | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly replicates all section dividers and labels. The card-based layout for the search and details sections, the vertical line in the 'Guests' input, and the 'DETAILS' section label are all present and correctly placed, matching the source design exactly. |
| Placeholder & Fallback Content | 10 | 10 | All placeholder text content and styling in the input fields perfectly match the source design. |
| Overflow & Clipping | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly replicates the source's handling of overflow and clipping. The text truncation with an ellipsis and the clipping of the 'Save 50%' banner against the rounded corner of the image container are identical to the source design. |

#### Styling & Effects
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Border Color | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source image's border colors. The subtle light grey borders on the input fields and the notification bell icon are accurately replicated with no discernible differences. |
| Border Radius | 6 | 10 | The 'Search' button's border radius is incorrect. In the source, it is a pill-shaped button with fully rounded ends. In the recreation, it is a rectangle with only slightly rounded corners, which significantly changes its appearance. |
| Iconography Match | 9 | 10 | The home icon in the bottom navigation bar is incorrect. The source uses a simple house icon, while the recreation uses a house icon that includes a chimney. All other icons are a perfect match in style and type. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Text & Typography
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation. No text is missing, and no extra text has been hallucinated. |
| Text Content Accuracy | 6 | 10 | The word 'take' is missing from the details paragraph ('Guests can take...'). Additionally, the 'Read More' label is incorrectly split across two lines instead of being a single, cohesive text element as shown in the source design. |
| Typography Family | 6 | 10 | A different sans-serif font family is used. While similar in style, letterforms differ. For example, the 'A' in "BALI" has a higher crossbar in the recreation. The overall character shapes in the recreation are also slightly wider and more rounded than in the source design. |
| Font Size | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Font Weight | 6 | 10 | The body text under "DETAILS" is noticeably lighter in the recreation compared to the source. The "Read More" link also appears less bold in the recreation. Other text elements like the main heading and button text have correctly matched font weights. |
| Line Height & Letter Spacing | 4 | 10 | The line height in the main description paragraph is significantly tighter in the recreation. This makes the text block appear more cramped and less readable compared to the more spacious and airy layout in the source design. |
| Text Alignment | 7 | 10 | The main description text block is justified in the source image, creating a clean right edge. In the recreation, this text is left-aligned, resulting in a ragged right edge, which is a deviation from the source design. |

| Accent & Icon Color | 10 | 10 | All accent and icon colors are a perfect match. This includes the teal 'Continue' button, the selected tab color, the yellow star icon, and the white icons in the header and button. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | All solid color fills for the background, cards, and buttons are accurate. The subtle dark gradient overlay at the top of the main image is also preserved correctly, matching the source design. |

#### Sizing & Dimension
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Width Consistency | 4 | 10 | The 'Continue' button is significantly wider in the recreation. Additionally, the rating box and the three category buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') are all noticeably wider than their counterparts in the source design, altering the component proportions. |
| Element Height Consistency | 7 | 10 | The main body text block is taller in the recreation. The text wraps to an additional line, pushing the "Read More" link down and increasing the component's height compared to the source design. |
| Icon/Asset Size | 7 | 10 | The header icons (back, share, heart), the rating star, and the arrow in the 'Continue' button are all slightly smaller in the recreation. The two main content images, however, appear to be sized correctly. |

| Relative Ordering | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct visual order, perfectly matching the source design. The hierarchy of components, from the header down to the call-to-action button, is identical. |
| Inner Padding | 7 | 10 | The horizontal inner padding for the main content card is incorrect. In the recreation, the padding is smaller, causing the 'DETAILS' text block to be wider and wrap differently than in the source. The text is noticeably closer to the card's left and right edges. |
| Inter-Component Horizontal Spacing | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |

#### Structure & Hierarchy
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Group Nesting | 3 | 10 | The "Continue" button is incorrectly nested within the description text block. In the source, it is a distinct element below the text, while in the recreation, it interrupts the "Read More" link, breaking the structure and nesting of the text group. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 3 | 10 | The "Continue" button in the recreation incorrectly overlaps and obscures the description text. In the source image, the button is positioned clearly below the text block, ensuring all content is readable and properly layered. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 12 | 15 | The vertical spacing within the main column is not preserved. The 'Continue' button is positioned too high, much closer to the text block above it than in the source. Additionally, the text wrapping for 'Read More' is broken across two lines, unlike the source's inline flow. |
| Label Hierarchy | 4 | 10 | The body text's font size is significantly larger than the source, disrupting the intended hierarchy between the 'DETAILS' heading and the paragraph. The 'Read More' link is also incorrectly broken onto a new line, altering the text flow and visual structure of the body content. |
| Repeated Content Uniformity | 0 | 15 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Section Dividers/Separators | 10 | 10 | The main content card, which separates the content from the header, is correctly implemented. The 'DETAILS' section label is also present and in the correct location. All separators and labels match the source design. |
| Placeholder & Fallback Content | 10 | 10 | No placeholder text or empty state content is present in the source design. The recreation correctly omits this content, resulting in a perfect match for this specific criterion. |
| Overflow & Clipping | 4 | 10 | The handling of the overflowing text in the "DETAILS" section is incorrect. In the recreation, the "Read More" link is broken across two lines, with "Read" on one line and "More" on the next. The source correctly keeps "Read More" as a single unit. |

| Iconography Match | 10 | 10 | All icons and images in the recreation perfectly match the source in both style and type. There are no discrepancies. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 2 | 10 | The recreation lacks the distinct drop shadows present in the source on the main content card, category buttons, image cards, and the 'Continue' button. This results in a flatter design that loses the sense of depth and elevation intended in the original UI. |

| Border Width | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source design, which does not utilize any visible borders on its UI elements. Both images consistently show no borders on buttons, cards, or the main content container. |

#### Spacing & Positioning
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element X-Axis Alignment | 7 | 10 | The star rating button is left-aligned in the recreation, directly under the location text. In the source design, this button is horizontally centered on the screen. |
| Element Y-Axis Alignment | 8 | 10 | The 'Indonesia' text is positioned too high, almost touching 'BALI', instead of being centered in the space below it. Additionally, the 'Read More' link is not perfectly baseline-aligned with the preceding text line, appearing slightly lower than in the source. |
| Relative Ordering | 8 | 10 | The relative vertical order of the header elements is incorrect. In the source, the rating is placed below the main title ('BALI'), but in the recreation, it has been moved below the subtitle ('Indonesia'). |
| Inner Padding | 10 | 10 | The inner padding for all elements, including the buttons, text blocks, and content cards, accurately matches the source design. No discrepancies were found. |
| Inter-Component Horizontal Spacing | 10 | 10 | The horizontal spacing between all components is a perfect match. This includes the spacing between the header icons, the category filter buttons, and the two image cards below them. No discrepancies were found. |
| Inter-Component Vertical Spacing | 4 | 10 | The vertical spacing is inconsistent. The gaps between the category buttons, image cards, and the 'DETAILS' heading are all larger than the source. Conversely, the space between the description text and the 'Continue' button is noticeably smaller, disrupting the original vertical rhythm. |

#### Structure & Hierarchy
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Group Nesting | 8 | 10 | The structure of the title group differs. In the source, the "BALI" title and "indonesia" subtitle are left-aligned and tightly grouped. In the recreation, they are center-aligned with more vertical space, which alters the structure of the visual group. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |

| Label Hierarchy | 5 | 10 | The visual hierarchy between the main heading and subheading is not preserved. In the recreation, the heading 'BALI' is smaller, while the subheading 'Indonesia' is larger and bolder than in the source. This flattens the hierarchy, making the subheading almost as prominent as the main heading. |

| Inner Padding | 7 | 10 | The vertical padding within the 'Details', 'Reviews', and 'Book Now' buttons is smaller than in the source. The text sits closer to the top and bottom edges of the buttons, making them feel more cramped vertically. |
| Inter-Component Horizontal Spacing | 10 | 10 | The horizontal spacing between all components is a perfect match. The space between the location text and the rating, and between the price and the 'Book Now' button, accurately reflects the source design. |
| Inter-Component Vertical Spacing | 6 | 10 | The vertical spacing between the title ("Villa Kayu Lama") and the location/rating line below it is too small. Conversely, the margin above the 'Details' and 'Reviews' tabs is slightly too large compared to the source design. |

| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source's layering. The bottom bar correctly overlaps the map content, and the header is properly stacked on top of the scrollable view. No discrepancies were found in the z-index of any element. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the overall single-column layout. It also accurately replicates the two-column structures for the header, location/rating row, and footer, as well as the horizontal grid for facilities. The grid structure is a perfect match. |
| Label Hierarchy | 7 | 10 | The visual hierarchy between the location and rating labels is not preserved. Their positions are swapped, and their relative font weights are inverted. In the recreation, the rating is given more prominence than the location, which is the opposite of the source design. |
| Repeated Content Uniformity | 12 | 15 | The horizontal spacing between repeated elements is inconsistent with the source. The gap between the 'Details' and 'Reviews' tabs is wider. Similarly, the spacing between each circular icon in the 'Facilities' list is larger in the recreation than in the source design, affecting the list's compactness. |

| Element X-Axis Alignment | 10 | 10 | All elements are perfectly aligned on the horizontal axis. Centered components like the title, rating, and buttons are correctly positioned. Left and right-aligned elements in the header and status bar also precisely match the source design. No discrepancies were found. |
| Element Y-Axis Alignment | 10 | 10 | The vertical alignment of all elements is a perfect match. Header icons are centered, category pills are aligned with each other, and image cards are top-aligned correctly. No issues were detected. |
| Relative Ordering | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct visual order. The title is above the subtitle, the rating number is before the star, and the text in the button is before the icon, matching the source design perfectly. |
| Inner Padding | 7 | 10 | The horizontal padding within the category buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') is wider in the recreation than in the source. The 'Continue' button also exhibits slightly more horizontal padding, making these interactive elements wider than specified in the original design. |
| Inter-Component Horizontal Spacing | 0 | 10 | Evaluation failed: [GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-pro:generateContent: fetch failed |
| Inter-Component Vertical Spacing | 8 | 10 | The vertical spacing between components inside the main card is slightly larger than in the source. This is noticeable between the category buttons and the image gallery, and again between the image gallery and the 'DETAILS' section, creating a slightly more spread-out layout. |
