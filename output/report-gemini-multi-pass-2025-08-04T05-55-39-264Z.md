### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 13 | 15 | The overall alignment is very good, with most elements being correctly aligned both horizontally and vertically. However, there is a minor discrepancy in the vertical positioning of the 'Search' button. In the recreation, the button is placed slightly higher than in the source image. This alters the vertical spacing, creating a smaller gap between the button and the 'Guests' input field above it, and a larger gap between the button and the content card below it, when compared to the source design. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct order and grouping, perfectly matching the source design. The sequence of icons and text within each component (like the input fields and the 'Save 50%' banner) is accurately replicated. The overall vertical stacking of sections and the horizontal order of icons in the navigation bar are also correct. |
| Element Size Consistency | 7 | 10 | Overall, the element dimensions are largely consistent with the source design. However, the primary 'Search' button in the recreation is noticeably shorter in height than in the source. Additionally, the circular background for the active 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar is slightly larger in the recreation. Other major components, like the input fields and the main content card, appear to match the source dimensions correctly. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly matches the source in terms of group nesting and hierarchy. All visual groups, including the header, the search form with its individual input fields, the main content card with its nested image and text blocks, and the navigation bar, are structured and nested correctly. The parent-child relationships between containers and their content are identical to the source design. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering of all elements in the recreation perfectly matches the source design. The bottom navigation bar correctly floats above the main content card, and the central '+' button correctly overlaps both the navigation bar and the content card above it. The 'Save 50%' banner is also correctly layered on top of the image. There are no discrepancies in the z-index stacking. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the column and grid structures from the source design. This includes the single-column layout of the main content and search form fields, the multi-column structure within the "Guests" input row, the two-column header layout, and the five-column grid of the bottom navigation bar. All elements are correctly aligned and spaced according to the source's grid system. |
| Padding Within Components | 7 | 10 | There are a few discrepancies in the inner padding of components. The most noticeable is the 'Search' button, which has less vertical padding in the recreation, making the text appear too large for the button's height. Additionally, the 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar is slightly too large for its background container, reducing the padding around it compared to the source design. Other components like the input fields are mostly accurate, but these key elements have clear padding issues. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 8 | 15 | The recreation exhibits several inaccuracies in vertical spacing between major components. The margins between the header, the three input fields, the search button, and the main content card are all noticeably larger than in the source design. This creates a more spaced-out layout in the top half of the screen. In contrast, the space between the main content card and the bottom navigation bar is slightly smaller than in the source. While the general order is correct, these consistent deviations in spacing significantly alter the vertical rhythm of the original design. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 14 | 20 | Most colors, including the main background, text, icons, and accent elements like the 'Save 50%' banner and active navigation icon, are a perfect match. However, there is a significant discrepancy in the primary 'Search' button. In the source image, the button has a vibrant cyan/teal background, consistent with other key accents. In the recreation, this button has a muted, dark blue-grey background, which does not match the intended design palette for primary actions. |
| Button States | 4 | 10 | The recreation correctly implements the selected state for the bottom navigation 'Home' icon, making it visually distinct from the unselected icons as shown in the source. However, the main 'Search' call-to-action button's default state is incorrect. The source design uses a vibrant teal to signify a primary, active button, while the recreation uses a muted, desaturated blue-grey. This color change significantly alters the visual language and could be misinterpreted as a disabled or secondary state, failing to match the source's intended design for button states. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font family used in the recreation is a perfect match to the source image. All text elements, including headings, input placeholders, body text, and button labels, utilize the same sans-serif font family with identical letterforms. |
| Font Size & Weight | 9 | 10 | The font sizes and weights are nearly a perfect match across the entire interface. The only noticeable discrepancy is the font weight of the text within the 'Search' button. In the source image, the text 'Search' has a bolder, heavier weight, making it stand out more. In the recreation, the font weight is lighter, appearing more like a medium or regular weight. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 8 | 10 | The alignment of all text elements, including the header, input fields, buttons, and titles, perfectly matches the source design. However, there is a minor inconsistency in the line height of the multi-line description text under the 'DETAILS' heading. In the recreation, the lines of text are closer together (tighter leading) compared to the more spaced-out and readable line height in the source image. |
| Border Styling | 4 | 10 | While the border radii for all components like cards, input fields, and the navigation bar are accurately replicated, the recreation fails to apply the border stroke itself. The source design consistently uses a thin, light grey border on the main content card, the details card, the notification icon container, and the bottom navigation bar. In the recreation, this border is either completely missing or so faint that it's not visible, which is a significant deviation from the source's styling. |
| Iconography & Assets | 9 | 10 | The iconography is almost perfectly replicated. All icons match the source in terms of style (outlined vs. filled) and relative size. The only minor discrepancy is the active 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar. The source icon has a unique, more rounded roof shape, whereas the recreation uses a more standard, sharper-peaked home icon asset. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 3 | 10 | While shadows have been applied to most of the correct elements, their implementation is inaccurate. The shadows in the recreation are consistently darker, harsher, and less diffused than the soft, subtle shadows in the source design. This is particularly noticeable on the floating action button (+), the bottom navigation bar, and the 'Search' button. Additionally, a shadow has been incorrectly added to the background of the selected 'Home' icon, which is not present in the source. The overall effect is a much heavier and less refined elevation compared to the original design. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | The recreation has perfectly preserved all gradient fills from the source image. The teal-to-darker-teal gradient on the "Save 50%" banner is accurately replicated, including the small orange/yellow gradient on the far right tip. Additionally, the yellow-to-orange gradient on the active "Home" icon in the bottom navigation bar is also a perfect match. All other elements that have solid fills in the source correctly have solid fills in the recreation. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 19 | 20 | The placement of almost all text elements is perfect. The placeholder text in the input fields ('Location', 'July 08 - July 15', '2 Guests'), the 'Search' button text, the 'DETAILS' title, and the main description paragraph are all positioned correctly. The only minor discrepancy is that the main title 'Hello, Sourany!' is positioned slightly higher in the recreation compared to the source image. This is a very subtle difference, resulting in a near-perfect score. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation. This includes the header greeting, search field placeholders and values, the 'Search' button text, the 'Save 50%' badge, the 'DETAILS' title, the description text, and the 'Read More' link. No text is missing or hallucinated. |
| Label Hierarchy | 8 | 10 | The overall label hierarchy is well-preserved, with headings, subheadings, and body text correctly ordered by size and placement. However, there are subtle but noticeable differences in font weight. The main heading 'Hello, Sourany!' and the 'Search' button text in the recreation appear to have a slightly lighter font weight than in the source, which reduces their visual prominence and slightly flattens the intended hierarchy. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures, specifically the three input fields in the search form and the four icons in the bottom navigation bar, are perfectly replicated. They maintain visual correctness and uniformity in terms of spacing, alignment, and styling, matching the source design exactly. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | The section title 'DETAILS' is positioned correctly, maintaining the same alignment and spacing as the source design. The large card element, which serves as the primary visual separator between the search controls and the content, is also placed accurately. There are no deviations in the placement of section labels or visual separators. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The placeholder text in all input fields ('Location', 'July 08 - July 15', '2 Guests') perfectly matches the source design. The font, color, and positioning (both vertical and horizontal relative to the icons and input fields) are all accurately replicated. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles all instances of overflow and clipping as seen in the source design. The text truncation in the 'DETAILS' section, indicated by an ellipsis and a 'Read More' link, is identical. The horizontal image carousel is correctly implemented with its content clipped by the container's rounded corners. The 'Save 50%' banner is also clipped correctly. The overall scrollable nature of the main content area is naturally implied and consistent with the source. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 12 | 15 | The recreation successfully replicates most visual feedback elements, such as the 'Save 50%' banner, the notification dot on the bell icon, and the highlighted 'home' icon in the bottom navigation. However, there is a significant discrepancy in the 'Search' button. In the source image, the button has a vibrant teal color, providing strong feedback as an active, primary call-to-action. In the recreation, the button's color is a muted, desaturated blue, which diminishes its visual prominence and fails to align with the expected active state communicated in the source design. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 13 | 15 | Most components are correctly aligned, both horizontally and vertically. The main title and rating are centered, the category tabs are vertically aligned, the gallery images are top-aligned, and the details text block is left-aligned, all matching the source. However, there is a minor misalignment in the header. The back arrow icon is positioned slightly lower than the 'indonesia' text and the icons on the right, whereas in the source design, all these elements share the same vertical centerline. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct order and grouped correctly, perfectly matching the source design. This includes the header elements (back arrow, location, action icons), the main title and rating, the category tabs, the details section, and the content within the 'Continue' button (text before icon). |
| Element Size Consistency | 6 | 10 | While the overall layout is correct, there are several inconsistencies in component dimensions. The main action buttons ('4.9 ★' rating, 'Hotels'/'Foods'/'Activities' filters, and 'Continue') are all slightly taller and wider in the recreation than in the source. Conversely, and more noticeably, the two photo gallery images are shorter in the recreation, which alters the vertical spacing and proportions of the content card. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly replicates the group nesting and hierarchy of the source design. All visual groups, such as the main content card containing the filter buttons, image cards, and the 'DETAILS' text block, are structured and nested correctly. The hierarchy within the header (title, subtitle, rating) is also a perfect match. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering of elements in the recreation is a perfect match to the source design. The main content card correctly overlaps the background image, and all other elements like header icons, text, and buttons are stacked in the correct order on their respective backgrounds. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the grid layouts from the source design. The 3-column layout for the filter buttons and the 2-column grid for the image cards are both replicated with accurate spacing and alignment, resulting in a perfect match. |
| Padding Within Components | 9 | 10 | The inner padding is almost perfect across all components. The padding within the rating pill and the category buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') matches the source. However, there is a minor discrepancy in the 'Continue' button. The content inside (the text 'Continue' and the arrow icon) is not perfectly centered horizontally; it is shifted slightly to the right, resulting in more padding on the left than on the right, unlike the source image where the padding is balanced. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 12 | 15 | The inter-component spacing is largely accurate, particularly the horizontal spacing between elements like the category buttons and the image cards. However, there are some inaccuracies in the vertical margins. The space between the description text and the 'Continue' button is significantly larger in the recreation. Additionally, the vertical gaps between the category buttons and the image gallery, and between the image gallery and the 'DETAILS' heading, are slightly smaller than in the source image. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | The recreation is a perfect match in terms of color. All background, text, and accent colors have been accurately replicated. The primary dark text, the lighter secondary text, the white text on dark backgrounds, the teal call-to-action button, the yellow star, and the light grey main background all match the source image precisely. There are no discernible differences in color or opacity. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly replicates the button states shown in the source design. The 'selected' state of the 'Hotels' button is visually distinct from the 'unselected' state of the 'Foods' and 'Activities' buttons, and the colors used for both states are an exact match to the source. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font family used in the recreation is an exact match to the source image. All text elements, from the main heading 'BALI' to the body paragraph and button labels, utilize the same sans-serif typeface with identical letterforms. |
| Font Size & Weight | 8 | 10 | The font sizes and weights are mostly accurate, but there are a few minor discrepancies. The "DETAILS" heading in the recreation appears to have a slightly lighter font weight compared to the source. Similarly, the bolded "Read More" text in the recreation is not as bold as it is in the source image. Other text elements, like the main title and button text, are matched well. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 10 | 10 | The text alignment and line height in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. All text elements, including the centered main title ('BALI'), the left-aligned 'DETAILS' section, and the centered button text, are correctly aligned. The line height in the multi-line description paragraph is also consistent with the source. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | The border styling is a perfect match. The border-radius on all elements, including the main content card, the category selection buttons, the image containers, and the 'Continue' button, accurately reflects the source design. There are no visible border strokes in either image, and this has been correctly implemented in the recreation. |
| Iconography & Assets | 10 | 10 | All icons and image assets in the recreation are a perfect match to the source design. This includes the header icons (back, share, heart), the rating star, the arrow in the 'Continue' button, and all photographic assets. The style (outlined vs. filled) and size of each element are correctly replicated. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 5 | 10 | The recreation correctly applies shadows to the elements that have elevation in the source design, such as the main content card, the selected 'Hotels' tab, the two image cards, and the 'Continue' button. However, the style of these shadows is incorrect. In the recreation, the shadows are consistently darker, less blurred, and less diffused than in the source. The source image features very soft, subtle, and spread-out shadows, creating a gentle elevation effect, whereas the recreation's shadows are harder and more pronounced, which alters the intended aesthetic. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly preserves all gradient fills and background patterns from the source image. The subtle dark gradient overlay at the top of the main image, which improves the visibility of the status bar icons, is accurately replicated. All other elements use solid fills, which are also correctly matched in the recreation. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 16 | 20 | While most text elements like the main title ('BALI'), subtitle ('indonesia'), and button labels ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') are correctly placed, there is a noticeable discrepancy in the 'DETAILS' section. The 'DETAILS' title, the subsequent paragraph, and the 'Read More' link are all positioned significantly higher in the recreation compared to the source image. This reduces the vertical spacing between the image cards and the text block, altering the layout's vertical rhythm. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation. This includes the time, location name, country, rating, category tabs ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), the 'DETAILS' header, the description paragraph, and the 'Continue' button text. No text is missing or has been hallucinated. |
| Label Hierarchy | 9 | 10 | The visual hierarchy of the labels is almost perfectly preserved. The main heading ('BALI'), its subheading ('indonesia'), the section heading ('DETAILS'), and the main body text all maintain their correct relative sizes and font weights. The only minor discrepancy is with the 'Read More' text. In the source image, 'Read More' has a slightly bolder font weight than the preceding body text, setting it apart as an interactive element. In the recreation, 'Read More' has the same font weight as the body text, which slightly flattens the hierarchy at that specific point. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures, which include the three category filter buttons and the two image cards, are perfectly replicated from the source design. They exhibit complete uniformity in terms of size, shape, spacing, and alignment, resulting in a flawless match for this criterion. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | The 'DETAILS' section title is correctly positioned relative to the image cards above it and the description text below it. The main content card, which acts as a primary visual separator, is also placed correctly. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The source design does not feature any elements with placeholder text, such as a search bar or input field. The recreation accurately reflects this by also omitting any such elements, resulting in a perfect match for this criterion. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles content overflow and clipping as shown in the source design. The 'DETAILS' text is truncated at the exact same point with an ellipsis, and the 'Read More' link is correctly implemented. The clipping of the content within the main card, which implies a scrollable area, is also identical to the source. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly matches the source design in terms of the visible feedback elements. The selected state of the 'Hotels' tab is visually identical to the source, clearly indicating the active category. Other feedback elements like the rating are also perfectly replicated. As there are no empty or error states depicted in the source image, the recreation correctly omits them, resulting in a perfect match for this criterion. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 10 | 15 | The primary alignment issue is with the main title block over the hero image. In the source design, the 'BALI' title, 'indonesia' subtitle, and the '4.9 ★' rating box are all horizontally centered on the screen. In the recreation, these three elements have been changed to be left-aligned, which significantly alters the layout and balance of the top section. Other elements, such as those within the main content card, appear to be correctly aligned. |
| Relative Positioning | 5 | 10 | While the overall structure and the elements within the main content card are ordered correctly, there is a significant error in the relative positioning of the elements layered on top of the main hero image. In the source design, the vertical order is the title 'BALI', the subtitle 'indonesia', and then the star rating badge. In the recreation, this order has been incorrectly changed to be the star rating badge, followed by the title 'BALI', and then the subtitle 'indonesia'. |
| Element Size Consistency | 7 | 10 | While most components, such as the category pills ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), the image cards, and the 'Continue' button, have dimensions that are consistent with the source design, there is a noticeable discrepancy in the hero section. The rating pill ('4.9' with the star) is significantly smaller in the recreation than in the source image. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 8 | 15 | While most of the visual groups within the main content card are structured correctly (e.g., the category buttons, the image gallery, and the details section), there is a critical error in the nesting and hierarchy of the main header information. In the source image, the hierarchy is clearly "BALI" (title), then "indonesia" (subtitle), followed by the "4.9 ★" rating below them. In the recreation, this order is completely inverted and rearranged: the rating appears first at the top, and the "indonesia" subtitle is incorrectly placed above the main "BALI" title. This fundamentally alters the intended information architecture and visual flow of the screen's most prominent section. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering of elements in the recreation perfectly matches the source design. The main content card correctly overlaps the background image. All UI elements, such as the header icons, title text, and rating badge, are correctly stacked on top of the background image. Elements within the content card, including the "10+" overlay on the image, are also layered correctly. There are no z-index discrepancies. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves all column and grid structures from the source design. The 3-column layout for the category buttons and the 2-column grid for the images are both replicated with accurate spacing and alignment. The single-column structure for the text content and the final button is also correctly implemented. |
| Padding Within Components | 8 | 10 | The inner padding for most components, including the category buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') and the main 'Continue' call-to-action button, is replicated accurately. However, the padding within the rating button ('4.9 ★') is incorrect. In the recreation, this button has noticeably less vertical and horizontal padding compared to the source, making the text and icon appear more cramped within the button's bounds. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 7 | 15 | While the spacing between components within the main white content card is largely accurate, there is a major discrepancy in the hero section. The rating badge ('4.9 ★') has been moved from below the 'indonesia' subtitle in the source to above the 'BALI' title in the recreation. This fundamentally alters the vertical margins and spacing between the rating badge, the main title, and the subtitle, which is a significant deviation from the source design's component layout. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | The recreation is a perfect color match to the source image. All background colors, including the main content card (#F3F6F9), the selected button (#E4E9F1), and the unselected buttons (#FFFFFF), are accurate. Text colors for headings, body copy, and buttons are also identical. Accent colors, such as the teal 'Continue' button (#2CB1B1) and the yellow star icon (#FFC107), are replicated precisely. There are no discernible differences in color or opacity. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The recreation accurately reproduces the visual distinction between button states as shown in the source design. The 'selected' state of the 'Hotels' button (darker background, dark text) is clearly differentiated from the 'unselected' state of the 'Foods' and 'Activities' buttons (white background, dark text), and the colors match the source perfectly. |
| Typography Family | 2 | 10 | The recreation uses a different font family from the source. This is most noticeable in key letterforms: the main heading 'BALI' in the recreation has a pointed 'A' while the source has a flat-top 'A'; the body text uses a single-story 'a' while the source uses a double-story 'a'; and the number '4' in the rating has a closed top in the recreation versus an open top in the source. These fundamental differences show that the correct font family was not used. |
| Font Size & Weight | 10 | 10 | The font sizes and weights across all text elements in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. This includes the main heading, subheadings, button text, and body copy. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 3 | 10 | While the text within the category buttons, the 'DETAILS' section, and the 'Continue' button are correctly aligned, there is a major alignment error in the main header. The title 'BALI', the subtitle 'indonesia', and the rating '4.9 ★' are all left-aligned in the recreation, whereas they are clearly center-aligned in the source design. This fundamentally changes the layout and visual hierarchy of the header section. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | The border styling is perfectly replicated. The border-radius on all elements, including the main content card, the category buttons, the image containers, and the 'Continue' button, precisely matches the source design. There are no visible borders (width or color) in either design, and this has been correctly implemented in the recreation. |
| Iconography & Assets | 10 | 10 | All icons in the recreation perfectly match the source in terms of style (outlined vs. filled) and size. The image assets used for the hero section and the gallery are also identical to the source design. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 8 | 10 | The recreation correctly applies shadows to most elements that require elevation, such as the main content card, the rating element, and the 'Continue' button. However, there is a minor discrepancy in the shadows for the two smaller image cards. In the source image, these cards have a very soft and diffuse shadow, while in the recreation, the shadow is slightly darker and has a harder edge, making it more pronounced than intended. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly preserves all gradient fills and background patterns from the source design. The linear gradient on the 'Continue' button is an exact match. Furthermore, the subtle gradient overlays on the main hero image and the '10+' image card are also accurately replicated, ensuring text legibility just as in the source. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 8 | 20 | There are significant text placement errors in the hero section of the screen. In the source image, the main title "BALI", the subtitle "indonesia", and the rating "4.9" are all centered horizontally. In the recreation, they are all left-aligned. Furthermore, the vertical order is incorrect: the recreation places the rating above the title, while the source places it below the subtitle. The text placement within the main content card below is largely correct, but the errors in the most prominent section are substantial. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation. This includes the time, location name, rating, category tabs, image overlay text, details header, description, and the 'Continue' button text. No text elements are missing or have been hallucinated. |
| Label Hierarchy | 4 | 10 | The visual hierarchy of the labels in the header section has been significantly altered. In the source image, the primary heading is "BALI", followed by the subheading "indonesia", and then the rating element "4.9". This establishes a clear top-down hierarchy. In the recreation, the rating element has been moved above the main "BALI" heading, which inverts the intended hierarchy and changes the primary focal point of the screen. While other label hierarchies (e.g., "DETAILS" and the body text) are preserved, this change to the main heading is a major deviation. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures, specifically the category filter buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') and the image gallery items, are visually identical to the source. They maintain uniform size, spacing, corner radii, and internal content alignment, resulting in a perfect match. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | All section labels, including the category tabs ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') and the 'DETAILS' title, are positioned correctly. The main white card, which acts as a visual separator for the content section, is also placed perfectly in relation to the elements above and within it, matching the source design. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | There are no placeholder text elements, such as a search bar with 'Search...', present in the source design. The recreation correctly reflects this by also not including any placeholder text, resulting in a perfect match for this specific criterion. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles all visible aspects of content overflow. The text clipping in the 'DETAILS' section, ending with '... Read More', is identical to the source. Additionally, the '10+' overlay on the second image, which indicates an overflow of content, is also replicated precisely. The main content area appears to be correctly clipped within its container, suggesting the scrollable region is defined as per the source design. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 7 | 15 | The primary visual feedback element, the rating '4.9 ⭐', is misplaced. In the source design, it is positioned below the main title 'BALI', but in the recreation, it has been moved above the title. This is a significant deviation in the layout and visual hierarchy of the feedback region compared to the source. |
