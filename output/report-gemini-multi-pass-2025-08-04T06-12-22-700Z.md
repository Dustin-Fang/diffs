### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 11 | 15 | In the header, the user avatar and notification bell are not vertically centered with the 'Hello, Sourany!' text as they are in the source. The 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar is positioned slightly higher than the other three navigation icons, breaking their vertical alignment. Within the 'Guests' input field, the text '2 Guests' is positioned closer to the left icon, altering the horizontal spacing and alignment compared to the source. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct order and grouped appropriately, perfectly matching the source design. The sequence of icons and text within input fields is accurate. The vertical stacking of components and the horizontal arrangement of navigation icons are also correct. |
| Element Size Consistency | 6 | 10 | The main 'Search' button in the recreation is noticeably shorter in height and slightly narrower than in the source design. The bottom navigation bar is shorter, and its icons, especially the central circular button, are significantly smaller. The three input fields (Location, Date, Guests) are also slightly shorter in height compared to the source. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly replicates the nesting of all components within the search form, correctly grouping icons with text fields and buttons. The main content card is also structured flawlessly, with the image, promotional banner, title, and description text correctly grouped as a single visual unit. The overall hierarchy of the page, from the header to the search form and content card, is identical to the source. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | All overlapping elements in the recreation are stacked correctly, perfectly matching the source design. The bottom navigation bar correctly sits on top of the main content card. The central floating action button is correctly layered above the navigation bar, and the "Save 50%" banner correctly overlaps the image. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The vertical stacking of the main components and the uniform spacing between the form fields are perfectly replicated. The multi-column layout within the 'Guests' input row is preserved exactly as in the source. The five-column grid for the bottom navigation bar is also accurately recreated with correct spacing. |
| Padding Within Components | 6 | 10 | The "Search" button in the recreation has less vertical padding compared to the source, making the button appear shorter. In the bottom navigation bar, the home icon is positioned lower within its background shape, resulting in uneven vertical padding. The content within the main input fields, such as the "Location" field, has slightly less left padding in the recreation. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 9 | 15 | The vertical margin between the "Guests" input and the "Search" button is smaller than in the source design. The space between the "Search" button and the main content card below it is significantly reduced in the recreation. Conversely, the gap between the main content card and the bottom navigation bar is slightly larger than in the source. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 10 | 20 | The 'Search' button's color is a muted blue-grey instead of the correct vibrant teal. The active 'Home' navigation icon has its colors swapped with its background, appearing as white on yellow instead of yellow on white. The sun icon in the 'Save 50%' banner is a slightly different, more orange shade of yellow. |
| Button States | 3 | 10 | The primary "Search" button's color is a muted blue-grey instead of the vibrant teal from the source, altering its visual hierarchy and perceived state. The selected "Home" icon in the bottom navigation bar incorrectly uses a yellow background instead of the specified white background. Furthermore, the selected "Home" icon's fill color is white in the recreation, differing from the teal color used in the source design. |
| Typography Family | 8 | 10 | The font used for the "Hello, Sourany!" heading in the recreation appears to be a lighter weight than the bold font in the source. Similarly, the text "Search" inside the button is less bold in the recreation compared to the source design. The "Read More" text also uses a lighter font weight in the recreation than the distinctly bolded version in the source. |
| Font Size & Weight | 6 | 10 | The text within the input fields ('Location', 'July 08 - July 15', '2 Guests') has a lighter font weight in the recreation than in the source. The 'Search' button text is also noticeably lighter in the recreation compared to the bolder weight in the source design. Finally, the 'Read More' link is less bold in the recreation. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 7 | 10 | The "Hello, Sourany!" text is centered between the avatar and notification icon in the recreation, but it is left-aligned with the avatar in the source. The line height of the main description paragraph is noticeably larger in the recreation. Additionally, the vertical spacing between the "DETAILS" heading and the paragraph below it is greater in the recreation. |
| Border Styling | 6 | 10 | The borders on the input fields are thicker and a darker shade of grey than the subtle borders in the source. The vertical divider in the 'Guests' input is noticeably thicker and darker in the recreation. The border around the notification bell is also slightly thicker and more prominent than in the original design. |
| Iconography & Assets | 7 | 10 | The active 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar has an inverted style, using a colored icon on a white background instead of a white icon on a colored background as seen in the source. Additionally, the color of the recreation's active icon is yellow, which is inconsistent with the teal color used in the source design. All other icons and assets appear to be correct in style and size. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 5 | 10 | The 'Search' button in the recreation has a distinct drop shadow, while the source button has a much more subtle, almost flat appearance. The shadow on the bottom navigation bar is harsher and less diffuse in the recreation compared to the softer, more spread-out shadow in the source. Additionally, the main white card's shadow in the recreation is slightly darker and less blurred than the very soft shadow seen in the source design. |
| Gradient/Fills | 8 | 10 | The solid fill color of the 'Search' button is a muted blue in the recreation, whereas it is a vibrant teal in the source design. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 15 | 20 | The "Hello, Sourany!" greeting is positioned slightly lower in the recreation compared to the source. The "Save 50%" text is shifted slightly down and to the right within its banner. The "DETAILS" title and the description paragraph below it are also positioned slightly lower than in the original design. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image, including the header, search fields, button labels, and descriptive text, are correctly present in the recreation. |
| Label Hierarchy | 7 | 10 | The main heading "Hello, Sourany!" has a lighter font weight in the recreation, reducing its prominence compared to the source. The "DETAILS" section heading is also less bold in the recreation than in the source design. The body text in the recreation has a heavier font weight, which diminishes the visual contrast and hierarchical distinction from the bold "Read More" link. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 13 | 15 | The home icon in the recreation's navigation bar is filled, which breaks the uniform outline style of the other repeated icons as seen in the source. The vertical line separating the minus and plus buttons in the "Guests" input is thicker and darker in the recreation. Additionally, the filter icon to the right of the "Location" input has a slightly different shape and weight compared to the source. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 7 | 10 | The "DETAILS" section title is positioned with more vertical space between it and the image above compared to the source design. The entire details card, which functions as a visual separator, is positioned lower on the screen. This creates a larger gap between the "Search" button and the details card than what is shown in the source. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The styling and positioning of the placeholder text in all input fields are a perfect match to the source image. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source's overflow handling for all relevant elements. The clipping of the main description text and the implementation of the 'Read More' link are identical to the source. Similarly, the image carousel is correctly clipped within its container, and the scroll indicator is present as in the original design. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 5 | 15 | The active state of the home icon in the bottom navigation bar is incorrect, using a yellow circle with a white icon instead of the source's white circle with a teal icon. The main "Search" call-to-action button is a muted blue-grey, which is a significant departure from the vibrant teal color in the source design. Additionally, the color of the icon within the "Save 50%" banner is a duller yellow in the recreation compared to the brighter yellow in the source. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 15 | 15 | All components are perfectly aligned both horizontally and vertically, exactly matching the source design. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct order and grouped correctly, perfectly matching the source design. |
| Element Size Consistency | 3 | 10 | The category pills for "Hotels", "Foods", and "Activities" are all significantly shorter in height in the recreation. The two image cards below the category pills are also shorter than their counterparts in the source design. Similarly, the "Continue" button at the bottom of the card is shorter in height in the recreation. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly nests all visual groups, including the header elements, the main title with its subtitle, and the rating component. The hierarchical structure within the main content card, from the category tabs down to the continue button, is an exact match to the source. The relationship and spacing between the 'DETAILS' title and its corresponding text block are also correctly implemented, maintaining the intended visual hierarchy. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering of all elements in the recreation is a perfect match to the source, with the main content card, header elements, and rating button all correctly stacked on top of the background image. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the three-element row for the category buttons and the two-column grid for the images, matching the source layout exactly. |
| Padding Within Components | 4 | 10 | The horizontal padding within the 'Hotels', 'Foods', and 'Activities' category buttons is smaller in the recreation, making the text appear cramped. Similarly, the 'Continue' button has less horizontal padding, pushing the text and arrow icon closer to the component's edges. The rating chip ('4.9 ★') also exhibits reduced horizontal padding compared to the source design. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 12 | 15 | The vertical margin between the category buttons and the image gallery is slightly smaller in the recreation. Additionally, the space between the image gallery and the 'DETAILS' heading is slightly larger than in the source. Finally, the margin between the description text and the 'Continue' button has been reduced in the recreation. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | All background, text, and accent colors are a perfect match to the source image, including the main card background, the 'Continue' button, and the text colors throughout the design. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The selected state for the 'Hotels' button is perfectly replicated with the correct background color and text style. The unselected states for the 'Foods' and 'Activities' buttons are also an exact match to the source design. All other buttons, including the primary 'Continue' button and the top navigation icons, are visually identical to the source. |
| Typography Family | 8 | 10 | The "Read More" text in the recreation appears to use a lighter font weight compared to the bolder version in the source image. The main body text under "DETAILS" also seems to be a slightly lighter weight in the recreation. Similarly, the font weight for the text inside the "Continue" button is lighter in the recreation than in the source. |
| Font Size & Weight | 10 | 10 | All font sizes and weights in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. The main heading 'BALI' correctly uses a large, bold font, while subheadings like 'DETAILS' and button text like 'Hotels' also accurately match the source. The body text and smaller labels show no discernible differences in size or weight from the original design. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 6 | 10 | The line height of the main description paragraph is larger in the recreation, causing the text to occupy more vertical space than in the source. The "Read More" text is incorrectly placed on a new line instead of being inline with the end of the paragraph. This incorrect placement also creates a larger and inconsistent vertical gap between the paragraph and the link. |
| Border Styling | 7 | 10 | The border on the selected 'Hotels' button is slightly thicker and a darker shade of grey in the recreation. The white border around the '4.9' rating pill is also marginally thicker than in the source design. Additionally, the corner radius of the two smaller image cards is slightly smaller in the recreation compared to the more rounded corners in the source. |
| Iconography & Assets | 4 | 10 | The back arrow icon in the header is filled in the recreation but outlined in the source. The arrow icon inside the 'Continue' button is also filled, whereas the source design uses an outlined style. Additionally, the share and heart icons in the recreation have a slightly heavier stroke weight compared to the source. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 4 | 10 | The selected 'Hotels' button incorrectly uses a drop shadow instead of the inner shadow seen in the source, failing to replicate the pressed state effect. The shadows on the unselected 'Foods' and 'Activities' buttons are slightly darker and more pronounced in the recreation. Additionally, the main content card's shadow is less diffuse and slightly harsher than the softer shadow in the source design. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | The subtle gradient overlay at the top of the main image is perfectly replicated in the recreation. The gradient behind the 'BALI' text and rating is also accurately preserved, matching the source in intensity and fade. All solid color fills for the background, content cards, and buttons are identical to the source design. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 15 | 20 | The main location title "BALI" and its sub-label "indonesia" are positioned slightly lower than in the source design. The "DETAILS" title and the following description paragraph are also shifted down and slightly to the left. Consequently, the "Read More" and "Continue" text labels are also positioned lower on the screen compared to the source. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source design are present in the recreation, with no missing or hallucinated text content. |
| Label Hierarchy | 8 | 10 | The "Read More" label in the recreation does not have the bolder font weight seen in the source image, making it less visually distinct from the body text. This change slightly flattens the hierarchy within the details paragraph, as the interactive link does not stand out as clearly. All other label hierarchies, including the main heading, subheading, and section titles, are correctly replicated. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 12 | 15 | The category buttons in the recreation are slightly wider and have more horizontal spacing between them than in the source. The two image cards are slightly smaller in the recreation and are positioned with a wider gap between them. Additionally, the corner radius of the image cards in the recreation is noticeably smaller than in the source design. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | The main content card, the category buttons, and the 'DETAILS' section title are all positioned in perfect alignment with the source design, showing no discrepancies in placement or spacing. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The source design does not contain any placeholder text elements, and the recreation correctly omits them as well, resulting in a perfect match for this criterion. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly implements the text overflow handling seen in the source design. The text in the "DETAILS" section is truncated at the same point with an ellipsis. The accompanying "Read More" link is also present and correctly positioned, matching the source's method for handling clipped content. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 15 | 15 | The visual feedback for the selected 'Hotels' tab in the recreation is identical to the source, with no difference in background color or text style. The unselected states for the 'Foods' and 'Activities' tabs are also perfectly replicated, showing no deviation from the source design. All other interactive elements that provide visual feedback, such as the 'Continue' button and header icons, are an exact match to the source. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 7 | 15 | The vertical alignment and order of the main title elements are incorrect, as the rating badge is placed above the 'BALI' title instead of below the 'indonesia' subtitle. Due to this reordering, the 'BALI' title and 'indonesia' subtitle are positioned much lower on the screen than in the source design. Additionally, the icons in the top navigation bar, such as the back arrow and share icon, are vertically misaligned and sit lower than their source counterparts. |
| Relative Positioning | 7 | 10 | The rating element is incorrectly placed above the main title 'BALI', whereas in the source it is located below both the title and subtitle. Consequently, the main title 'BALI' is positioned below the rating in the recreation, which is the reverse of the source design. The subtitle 'indonesia' is also shifted down as a result of the misplaced rating element. |
| Element Size Consistency | 4 | 10 | The rating pill is smaller in both height and width in the recreation compared to the source. The main 'BALI' title text block is significantly smaller in the recreation. The 'Continue' button at the bottom is noticeably shorter in height than the one in the source design. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 10 | 15 | The rating element is incorrectly placed above the main title, whereas in the source it is located below the title and subtitle group. The main title "BALI" and the subtitle "indonesia" have increased vertical spacing between them, which weakens their visual grouping compared to the source. These changes alter the intended visual hierarchy of the header information block, where the location name should be the primary element. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | All elements are layered correctly according to the source design. The main content card correctly sits on top of the background image. The header icons and rating button are also correctly layered over the background image. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 8 | 15 | The vertical stacking order of the header elements is incorrect, with the rating element moved from below the 'BALI' text to above it. The horizontal spacing between the three category buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') is narrower than in the source. Similarly, the gutter between the two images in the two-column grid is narrower in the recreation. |
| Padding Within Components | 9 | 10 | The horizontal padding within the rating tag is slightly different; the recreation has more symmetrical padding on the left and right of the content, whereas the source has slightly less padding on the right side of the star. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 7 | 15 | The "4.9 star" rating is incorrectly positioned above the "BALI" title instead of below it, altering its spacing with the title and the main content card. The vertical margin between the description paragraph and the "Continue" button is significantly larger in the recreation. There is also increased vertical space between the category buttons and the image grid below them. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | All background, text, and accent colors in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image, including the opacity of elements like the rating pill and the gradient overlay on the main image. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The selected state of the 'Hotels' button, with its darker background and white text, is perfectly replicated from the source design. The unselected states of the 'Foods' and 'Activities' buttons also precisely match the lighter background and dark text seen in the source. Therefore, the visual distinction between the different button states is flawlessly implemented. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font family used for all headings, such as 'BALI' and 'DETAILS', is an exact match to the source. The font family for the body text and button labels like 'Hotels' and 'Continue' is also identical to the source image. There are no discernible differences in the typography family across any element in the UI. |
| Font Size & Weight | 6 | 10 | The main heading "BALI" has a lighter font weight in the recreation compared to the heavier, bolder weight used in the source design. The subheading "indonesia" also appears to have a slightly lighter font weight in the recreation. Furthermore, the "DETAILS" label and the "Read More" link are not as bold in the recreation as they are in the source. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 3 | 10 | The main heading 'BALI' and subheading 'indonesia' are left-aligned in the recreation, whereas they are center-aligned in the source design. The rating element is also left-aligned in the recreation, deviating from its centered alignment in the source. The vertical spacing between the 'BALI' heading and the 'indonesia' subheading is noticeably larger in the recreation compared to the source. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | All border radii on components such as the main content card, buttons, and image cards perfectly match the source design. |
| Iconography & Assets | 10 | 10 | All icons, including the back arrow, share, and heart icons, perfectly match the source in style, weight, and size. The star icon in the rating is correctly filled and colored, matching the source. The images used for the main background and the gallery are identical to the source assets. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 4 | 10 | The drop shadow on the 'Continue' button is significantly darker and harsher in the recreation compared to the soft, subtle shadow in the source. The category buttons for 'Hotels,' 'Foods,' and 'Activities' are missing the subtle inner shadow effect present in the source, making them appear flat. The shadows on the top navigation icons and the rating badge are much more pronounced and less diffuse than the delicate shadows in the original design. |
| Gradient/Fills | 3 | 10 | The recreation is missing the dark gradient overlay at the top of the main background image, which reduces the contrast and legibility of the status bar elements. The source design includes this gradient to make the white text and icons stand out against the bright sky. While the gradient on the smaller '10+' image is present, the omission of the primary screen gradient is a significant deviation. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 5 | 20 | The main title 'BALI' is left-aligned instead of being centered as shown in the source image. The 'indonesia' subtitle is also left-aligned instead of centered. The rating '4.9' is incorrectly placed above the title and to the left, while in the source it is centered below the subtitle. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are correctly present in the recreation, including headers, labels, descriptions, and button text. |
| Label Hierarchy | 6 | 10 | The main heading 'BALI' and its subheading 'indonesia' have been changed from centered to left-aligned, altering the visual presentation of their hierarchy. The rating element has been moved from below the main heading to above it, which disrupts the original information hierarchy. The font weight for the main heading 'BALI' also appears slightly lighter in the recreation compared to the bolder weight in the source. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated category buttons for 'Hotels', 'Foods', and 'Activities' are uniform in size, spacing, and style, perfectly matching the source design. The two image cards below are also consistent in their dimensions, corner radius, and spacing, replicating the source accurately. Overall, all repeated content structures are visually correct and uniform with no discrepancies. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 8 | 10 | The 'DETAILS' section title is positioned slightly higher in the recreation than in the source image. This reduces the vertical spacing between the image cards and the title. Additionally, the gap between the 'DETAILS' title and the description text below it is smaller in the recreation. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The source design does not contain any placeholder text elements, and the recreation correctly omits them as well, resulting in a perfect match for this criterion. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The text clipping in the details section, indicated by the 'Read More' link, is perfectly replicated from the source. The overflow indicator in the image gallery, represented by the '10+' overlay, is also identical in appearance and placement. The overall implied scrollable area of the main content card looks natural and perfectly follows the design constraints shown in the source image. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 10 | 15 | The rating pill, a key feedback element, is incorrectly positioned above the main 'BALI' title instead of below it. This misplacement alters the intended visual hierarchy of the header section. As a result of the rating pill's new position, the 'BALI' title and the 'indonesia' subtitle are both shifted down. |
