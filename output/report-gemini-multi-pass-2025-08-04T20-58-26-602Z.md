| Font Size | 10 | 10 | All font sizes appear to be perfectly matched across all text elements, including headers, input fields, buttons, and body text. No discrepancies were found between the recreation and the source image. |
| Font Weight | 10 | 10 | All font weights in the recreation accurately match the source. The bold headings, calls-to-action, and links contrast correctly with the regular weight of the body text and input placeholders. No discrepancies are present. |
| Line Height & Letter Spacing | 10 | 10 | The line height in the main description paragraph and the letter spacing for all text elements, including the tracked-out 'DETAILS' heading, are perfectly replicated from the source design. No deviations are present. |
| Text Alignment | 10 | 10 | The text alignment for all elements in the recreation is a perfect match to the source. All headers, input fields, buttons, and body text maintain the correct left or center alignment as specified in the original design. |

#### Color & Fill
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Background Color | 10 | 10 | The background colors of the overall UI and individual components, including the main background, cards, buttons, and navigation bar, are all accurately replicated from the source design. No discrepancies were found. |
| Text Color | 10 | 10 | All text colors are a perfect match. The black header, gray body copy, and white text on buttons and banners are all accurately replicated from the source design. |
| Accent & Icon Color | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source's accent colors, including the main teal and the yellow highlight. All icon colors and their opacities are also identical, resulting in a flawless replication for this criterion. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly replicates all gradients and fills. The main background gradient, the 'Save 50%' banner gradient, and the active navigation tab's background gradient are all identical to the source design in color, angle, and intensity. |

#### Sizing & Dimension
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Width Consistency | 5 | 10 | The 'Search' button is significantly wider in the recreation compared to the source. The input fields for 'Location', 'Date', and 'Guests' are also slightly wider, which alters the horizontal spacing and balance of the search form. |
| Element Height Consistency | 10 | 10 | The heights of all components, including the input fields, search button, content card, and bottom navigation bar, are perfectly consistent with the source design. No discrepancies in element height were found. |
| Icon/Asset Size | 6 | 10 | The notification bell icon, the 'thumb' icon in the 'Save' banner, and all icons in the bottom navigation bar are noticeably smaller in the recreation. The central plus icon is also smaller than in the source design. |
| Border Width | 10 | 10 | The border widths on all elements, including the input fields, the notification icon, and the main content card, are a perfect match to the source image. No discrepancies were found. |

#### Spacing & Positioning
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element X-Axis Alignment | 10 | 10 | The horizontal alignment of all elements is a perfect match to the source design. The header text, form inputs, card content, and bottom navigation icons are all correctly centered or aligned to the left and right edges as specified in the source. |
| Element Y-Axis Alignment | 10 | 10 | All components are perfectly aligned on the vertical axis. Icons and text within the header, search fields, and bottom navigation bar are all correctly centered within their respective containers, matching the source design precisely. |
| Relative Ordering | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct visual order. Icons are correctly positioned before their corresponding text, and titles are placed above their descriptions. The relative ordering of all components perfectly matches the source design. |
| Inner Padding | 6 | 10 | The vertical padding inside the 'Search' button is significantly smaller than in the source. The Location, Date, and Guests input fields have slightly more vertical padding. The 'Save 50%' tag also has tighter padding, especially to the left of the text. |
| Inter-Component Horizontal Spacing | 10 | 10 | The horizontal spacing between all components is a perfect match. This includes the header elements, the icons and text within the input fields, and the icons in the bottom navigation bar. No discrepancies were found. |
| Inter-Component Vertical Spacing | 10 | 10 | The vertical spacing between all components, including the header, search form elements, content card, and bottom navigation, is a perfect match to the source design. No discrepancies were found. |

#### Structure & Hierarchy
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Group Nesting | 10 | 10 | The visual groups in the recreation, such as the main content card containing the image, title, and description, are perfectly nested and structured, matching the source image exactly. |

| Section Dividers/Separators | 10 | 10 | All visual separators, including the input fields, the vertical line in the guest counter, and the main content card, are present and correctly placed. The "DETAILS" section label is also correctly implemented, matching the source design. |
| Placeholder & Fallback Content | 7 | 10 | The placeholder text content is correct. However, the font weight for the text in all three input fields ("Location", "July 08 - July 15", "2 Guests") is noticeably lighter in the recreation compared to the bolder weight used in the source design. |
| Overflow & Clipping | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles text overflow with truncation and a 'Read More' link. The clipping of the 'Save 50%' banner against the rounded corner of the image container is also identical to the source design. |
