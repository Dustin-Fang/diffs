### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 13 | 15 | The overall alignment is very good, with most components matching the source design. However, there are two minor vertical alignment discrepancies. First, the profile picture in the header is not perfectly vertically centered with the 'Hello, Sourany!' text; it is positioned slightly lower than in the source. Second, within the '2 Guests' input field, the text and icon are not vertically centered with the minus and plus buttons, also appearing slightly lower than in the source design. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct order and grouped correctly, perfectly matching the source design. The arrangement of icons and text in the header, search form fields, guest counter, and bottom navigation bar is identical to the source. The vertical stacking of components (header, form, card, nav bar) is also correct. |
| Element Size Consistency | 8 | 10 | While most component dimensions are consistent with the source design, there are a few noticeable discrepancies. The primary "Search" button in the recreation is significantly shorter in height compared to the source. Additionally, the profile picture and the notification bell icon in the header are marginally smaller in the recreation. The input fields and bottom navigation elements, however, appear to be sized correctly. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly matches the source image in terms of group nesting and hierarchy. All major visual groups—the header, the search form, the main content card, and the bottom navigation bar—are structured identically to the source. The internal nesting within these groups is also flawless; for example, the 'DETAILS' title and the subsequent description are correctly grouped, and the 'Save 50%' tag is properly nested within the image container. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering of all elements in the recreation perfectly matches the source image. The 'Save 50%' banner correctly overlaps the image, the content card correctly sits above the main card, and the bottom navigation bar, along with its elevated central button, correctly overlaps the content card below it. There are no z-index discrepancies. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves all column and grid structures from the source design. The two-column header, the single-column list of search fields, the internal structure of the guest-count input, and the five-column bottom navigation bar are all replicated with accurate alignment and spacing. There are no deviations in the layout structure. |
| Padding Within Components | 7 | 10 | While the padding within the 'Location', 'Date', and 'Guests' input fields is replicated accurately, there are noticeable discrepancies in other key components. The primary 'Search' button has significantly less vertical padding in the recreation, making the text appear cramped. Additionally, the active 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar has less padding within its background shape compared to the source. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 15 | 15 | The inter-component spacing in the recreation is a perfect match to the source design. The vertical margins between the header, the three input fields, the 'Search' button, and the subsequent 'Details' card are all replicated with high fidelity. There are no discernible differences in the spacing between these distinct UI elements. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 16 | 20 | Most colors, including backgrounds, text, and icons, are a perfect match to the source image. However, there is a significant discrepancy in the color of the primary 'Search' button. The recreation uses a muted blue-grey (#536D85) instead of the vibrant teal (#28B5B5) from the source design, which is a major deviation for a key call-to-action element. |
| Button States | 3 | 10 | There are significant discrepancies in the button states. The primary 'Search' button's color is incorrect; it is a muted blue-grey in the recreation instead of the vibrant teal from the source design. Additionally, the 'selected' state of the 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar is different. The source shows a white icon on a filled grey background, while the recreation shows a colored (orange/yellow) icon on a white background. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font family used in the recreation is a perfect match to the source image. All text elements, from headings like 'Hello, Sourany!' to body text and button labels, utilize the same sans-serif font with identical letterforms. |
| Font Size & Weight | 6 | 10 | While the font sizes are generally well-matched, there is a consistent discrepancy in font weight. The main greeting 'Hello, Sourany!' is correct, but nearly all other text elements—including the input field placeholders, the 'Search' button text, the 'DETAILS' heading, the body text, and the 'Read More' link—appear to have a lighter font weight in the recreation compared to the bolder, more substantial text in the source design. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 8 | 10 | While the horizontal alignment of all text elements (left-aligned for headings and paragraphs, centered for the button) is correct, there is a noticeable discrepancy in the vertical spacing. The line height of the main paragraph under the 'DETAILS' section is slightly larger in the recreation compared to the source. This causes the entire text block to occupy more vertical space and alters the spacing between the lines. |
| Border Styling | 7 | 10 | The recreation accurately captures the border styling for most elements, including the notification bell, the guest counter's internal separator, and the main bottom navigation bar. However, it misses the subtle, light-grey borders on the 'Location', 'Date', and 'Guests' input fields, which are present in the source design. This omission makes these fields appear flatter and less defined than intended. |
| Iconography & Assets | 9 | 10 | The iconography is nearly a perfect match. All icons, from the search and filter icons to the navigation bar icons, are correct in style (outlined vs. filled) and size. The main image assets are also correct. The only discrepancy is the background color of the active 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar. In the source, it's a light blue, but in the recreation, it's a light orange/yellow. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 7 | 10 | The recreation correctly applies shadows to most elements to create a sense of elevation, particularly on the bottom navigation bar, the floating action button, and the main content card. However, there is a notable discrepancy in the 'Search' button's shadow. In the source image, the shadow is very subtle and light, whereas in the recreation, it is much darker and more pronounced, creating a harsher look that deviates from the original design's soft aesthetic. The shadow on the main search form card is also slightly darker than the source. |
| Gradient/Fills | 4 | 10 | The recreation successfully replicates the gradients on the "Save 50%" banner and the active "Home" icon. However, it fails on two major elements: the main background is a solid color instead of the subtle gradient seen in the source, and the "Search" button uses a muted, desaturated blue fill instead of the vibrant teal from the original design. The missing background gradient is a significant deviation from the source design. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 17 | 20 | The text placement is largely accurate, but there are a couple of minor deviations. The main greeting, 'Hello, Sourany!', is positioned slightly lower in the recreation compared to the source. Additionally, the 'Save 50%' text within the promotional banner is also placed lower, appearing more vertically centered in the recreation, whereas it is positioned higher in the source design. The rest of the text elements are placed correctly. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are perfectly replicated in the recreation. This includes the header text, input field placeholders, button text, image tag, and the description paragraph. There are no missing or hallucinated text elements. |
| Label Hierarchy | 10 | 10 | The visual hierarchy is perfectly preserved. The main heading ("Hello, Sourany!"), the subheading ("DETAILS"), the body text, and the link ("Read More") all maintain their distinct and relative font sizes and weights as seen in the source image. The relationship between each text element is identical, ensuring the user's focus and reading flow match the original design intent. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly matches the source in terms of repeated content structures. The list of three input fields (Location, Date, Guests) maintains the same uniform shape, size, internal alignment of icons and text, and vertical spacing as the source. Similarly, the icons in the bottom navigation bar are repeated with correct and uniform spacing. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | All section titles and visual dividers are perfectly placed. The 'DETAILS' title is correctly positioned above the description, and the cards that visually separate the search form and the main content section are accurately located, matching the source design. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 6 | 10 | The placeholder text content and positioning are correct. However, the styling is inaccurate. In the recreation, the font weight for all three placeholders ("Location", "July 08 - July 15", and "2 Guests") is noticeably thinner than in the source image. Additionally, the color of the placeholder text is a lighter shade of gray compared to the darker, more prominent gray used in the source design. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source design in its handling of overflow. The truncated description text with the 'Read More' link is identical, and the clipping of the image within its container, including the indicator for horizontal scrolling, is also a perfect match. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 5 | 15 | The recreation deviates significantly from the source in key areas that provide visual feedback to the user. The most prominent call-to-action, the 'Search' button, has a muted, desaturated blue-grey color, failing to match the vibrant, attention-grabbing teal from the source. Additionally, the visual feedback for the active state in the bottom navigation is incorrect; the 'Home' icon's background is a pale, desaturated yellow instead of the bright, saturated orange-yellow in the source. This weakens the feedback indicating the user's current screen. Lastly, the small notification dot on the bell icon is missing in the recreation. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 15 | 15 | The element alignment in the recreation is a perfect match to the source image. All components are correctly aligned both horizontally and vertically. The header elements ('indonesia', 'BALI', '4.9 ★') are perfectly centered. The category tabs ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') are aligned correctly in their row. The two image cards below the tabs are perfectly top-aligned with each other. The 'DETAILS' section text is correctly left-aligned, and the 'Continue' button is perfectly centered horizontally at the bottom of the card. No alignment issues were detected. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | All elements in the recreation are placed in the correct order and grouped appropriately, perfectly matching the source design. The sequence of icons in the header, the order of the category tabs, the arrangement of text and icons within the rating and button elements, and the vertical stacking of all sections are identical to the source. |
| Element Size Consistency | 10 | 10 | The dimensions (width and height) of all components in the recreation are a perfect match to the source design. This includes the header icons, the category filter buttons, the image cards, and the 'Continue' button. There are no discernible differences in element sizing. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly matches the source in terms of group nesting and hierarchy. All visual groups, including the header elements, the main title/subtitle on the image, the category tabs, the image gallery, and the details section with its title and body text, are structured and nested exactly as they are in the source design. The visual hierarchy is flawlessly replicated. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering of elements in the recreation is a perfect match to the source. The main content card correctly overlaps the background image, and all floating elements such as the top icons, header text, and rating badge are correctly stacked on top of the background, consistent with the source design. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the column and grid structure of the source design. The row of three category buttons is correctly implemented as a 1x3 grid with uniform spacing. The two-column image grid below is also perfectly replicated, maintaining the correct number of columns and the precise gap between them. The overall single-column layout of the content sections is also identical to the source. |
| Padding Within Components | 10 | 10 | The inner padding within all components is a perfect match to the source design. This includes the horizontal and vertical padding for the content inside the rating pill ('4.9 ⭐'), the category filter buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), and the 'Continue' button. The content is correctly centered within each component, replicating the source exactly. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 14 | 15 | The inter-component spacing is largely accurate and well-replicated. However, there is one noticeable discrepancy: the vertical margin between the description text block and the 'Continue' button is significantly larger in the recreation than in the source image. All other major spacings, such as between the category buttons, the image gallery, and the details section, are a near-perfect match. |

#### Visual Design

| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | After a thorough review using a color picker, all colors in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. This includes the main background, the various button states (selected, unselected, and primary action), all text colors, and accent colors like the star icon. The opacities on elements like the top bar icons and the rating button are also accurately reproduced. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly implements the different button states as shown in the source design. The 'selected' state for the 'Hotels' button is clearly distinguished from the unselected states of the other category buttons through a change in background color, matching the source exactly. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The typography family used in the recreation is a perfect match to the source image. All text elements, including headings, body text, and button labels, utilize the correct font, showing no signs of using a fallback or incorrect font family. |
| Font Size & Weight | 10 | 10 | All font sizes and weights in the recreation are a perfect match to the source. This includes the large, bold heading 'BALI', the smaller 'indonesia' subheading, the bold 'DETAILS' title, the body text, the bolded 'Read More' link, and the text within the category and 'Continue' buttons. There are no deviations found. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 7 | 10 | Most text elements are correctly aligned and spaced according to the source image. However, there is a notable discrepancy in the main description paragraph. In the source image, the 'Read More' text is on the same line as the truncated paragraph. In the recreation, 'Read More' has been incorrectly placed on a new line, which alters the line spacing and layout of this text block. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | The border styling is perfectly replicated. All elements, including the main content card, the category buttons, the image cards, and the 'Continue' button, have the correct border-radius, matching the source image precisely. There are no visible border strokes in either image, which is also accurate. |
| Iconography & Assets | 10 | 10 | All icons and image assets in the recreation are a perfect match for the source design. The style (e.g., outlined top icons, filled star icon), size, and specific assets (e.g., the two photos) are all correctly implemented. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 6 | 10 | The recreation correctly applies drop shadows to most elements that require them, such as the main card, image cards, and buttons. However, the shadow properties often differ from the source; they tend to be slightly darker and less blurred, resulting in a harsher look (e.g., on the main card and the rating button). The most significant error is on the category filter buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'). The source uses a subtle inner shadow on the selected 'Hotels' button to indicate a pressed state, while the recreation incorrectly applies a standard drop shadow to all three buttons, losing this important visual cue. |
| Gradient/Fills | 4 | 10 | The recreation fails to replicate the gradient on the 'Continue' button. The source design features a clear horizontal linear gradient from a lighter teal to a darker teal, while the recreation uses a single, flat teal color. Other solid fills and the header image's gradient overlay are correctly implemented, but the missed gradient on the primary call-to-action button is a significant deviation. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 20 | 20 | The placement of all text elements in the recreation is a perfect match to the source image. This includes the header text ('indonesia', 'BALI'), the category button labels ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), the 'DETAILS' title, the body paragraph, and the 'Continue' button text. All horizontal and vertical alignments and spacing are accurately replicated. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image, including the time, location, rating, category tabs, details heading, description paragraph, and button text, are present and accurately represented in the recreation. There are no missing or hallucinated text elements. |
| Label Hierarchy | 8 | 10 | The overall label hierarchy between the main heading ("BALI"), its subheading ("indonesia"), the section heading ("DETAILS"), and the body text is well-preserved. However, there is a notable discrepancy in the "Read More" text. In the source image, "Read More" is bold, creating a clear visual distinction from the preceding body text and highlighting its interactive nature. In the recreation, "Read More" has the same font weight as the body text, which flattens the hierarchy within that text block and makes the interactive element less prominent. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures, which include the horizontal list of category buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') and the two image cards, are perfectly replicated. Both sets of items are uniform in size, spacing, and corner radius, exactly matching the source design. There are no discrepancies in this category. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | All section titles and visual dividers are perfectly replicated. The main content card is positioned correctly, the category selection buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') are placed accurately, and the 'DETAILS' section title is in the correct location with the proper spacing and alignment relative to surrounding elements. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The user interface shown in the source image does not contain any input fields with placeholder text. The recreation correctly omits these elements as well, making it a perfect match for this specific criterion. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly replicates the overflow handling of the source design. The truncated 'DETAILS' text with the 'Read More' link is identical, and the clipping of the horizontally scrollable image list is also a perfect match. There are no discernible differences in how scrollable or clipped areas are presented. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly replicates the visual feedback elements present in the source design. The selected state of the 'Hotels' button, indicated by its background color and text weight, is identical to the source. Similarly, the rating badge, which provides feedback on the location's score, is also a perfect match in terms of color, font, icon, and shadow. There are no discrepancies in how visual feedback is presented. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 12 | 15 | Most elements are correctly aligned, including the header icons, category buttons, image gallery, and the 'Details' text block. However, there is a significant alignment discrepancy in the hero section. In the source image, the '4.9 ★' rating is centered horizontally above the 'BALI' and 'indonesia' text. In the recreation, the rating element is left-aligned with the text below it, which is incorrect. |
| Relative Positioning | 5 | 10 | While most elements are grouped and ordered correctly, there is a major discrepancy in the relative positioning of the elements in the hero section. In the source image, the main heading 'BALI' is positioned above the '4.9' star rating. In the recreation, this order is reversed, with the rating placed above the 'BALI' heading. This significantly changes the visual hierarchy and relative order of these primary elements. |
| Element Size Consistency | 7 | 10 | While most component dimensions are accurate, such as the category buttons, image cards, and the 'Continue' button, there is a significant size discrepancy in the main heading text. The text 'BALI' in the recreation is considerably smaller in both height and width than in the source design. Conversely, the 'indonesia' sub-heading text is larger in the recreation than in the source. These inconsistencies in the primary text elements prevent a perfect score. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 9 | 15 | The recreation incorrectly restructures the main title group. In the source, the title ('BALI') and subtitle ('indonesia') are grouped together to form a cohesive unit, with the rating element placed below them. In the recreation, the rating element is moved above the main title, which separates the title from its subtitle and disrupts the intended visual hierarchy and nesting of the location's core information. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering of elements in the recreation perfectly matches the source design. The main content card correctly sits on top of the background image, and all other elements, such as the header icons and the '10+' text overlay on the image card, are stacked in the correct z-order. There are no layering or stacking issues. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 12 | 15 | The recreation successfully implements the main grid structures of the design, such as the three-button horizontal layout and the two-column image grid below it. The spacing and alignment within these components are accurate. However, there is a significant error in the column structure of the header content. In the source design, the '4.9' rating element is positioned below the 'BALI' title. In the recreation, this element has been incorrectly moved above the 'BALI' title, altering the intended vertical layout and information hierarchy. |
| Padding Within Components | 7 | 10 | The padding within most components is well-replicated, particularly in the 'Continue' button and the '10+' image overlay. However, there are discrepancies in the pill-shaped components. The rating pill ('4.9 ★') in the recreation is noticeably narrower than the source, resulting in significantly less horizontal padding around the text and star. The category pills ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') also appear to have slightly less horizontal padding, making them look tighter than in the source design. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 7 | 15 | There are several significant discrepancies in inter-component spacing. The most prominent error is the positioning of the '4.9' rating badge; in the source, it is located below the 'indonesia' text, but in the recreation, it has been moved up to be level with the 'BALI' text, completely altering the vertical spacing in the header. Additionally, the vertical margin between the details paragraph and the 'Continue' button at the bottom is noticeably larger in the recreation than in the source. The spacing between the category filter buttons and the image gallery below them also appears slightly increased. While some horizontal spacing (like between the category buttons) is accurate, the major vertical spacing errors justify a significant point deduction. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | The recreation is a perfect match to the source image in terms of color. All background, text, and accent colors have been replicated exactly. This includes the main card background, the selected and unselected category pills, the 'Continue' button, and all text elements. The opacity of overlays, such as the gradient at the top of the screen and the dark overlay on the '10+' image, are also accurately reproduced. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly implements the different button states visible in the source design. The 'selected' state of the 'Hotels' button, with its distinct grey background, is accurately reproduced. Similarly, the 'unselected' state of the 'Foods' and 'Activities' buttons, with their white backgrounds, matches the source exactly. The primary 'Continue' button also mirrors the design's styling, ensuring all visible states are correctly represented. |
| Typography Family | 2 | 10 | The recreation uses an incorrect font family. This is most noticeable in the body text, where the source uses a font with a double-story 'a' (e.g., in 'Kayu Lama'), while the recreation uses a font with a single-story 'a'. Additionally, the main heading 'BALI' in the source uses a capital 'A' with a flat top, whereas the recreation's 'A' is pointed. The overall character shapes across the UI are different, indicating a complete font family mismatch. |
| Font Size & Weight | 6 | 10 | While most of the text elements, such as the category buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), the 'DETAILS' heading, and the body text, have font sizes and weights that match the source design well, there are significant discrepancies in the main hero section. The primary heading 'BALI' is noticeably smaller in the recreation. Similarly, the 'indonesia' subheading and the '4.9' rating text are also smaller than in the source image. These differences in the most prominent text elements alter the intended visual hierarchy. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 3 | 10 | There is a major discrepancy in the text alignment of the hero section. In the source image, the main title 'BALI', the subtitle 'indonesia', and the rating '4.9' are all center-aligned on the screen. In the recreation, these elements have been incorrectly left-aligned. This is a fundamental change to the design's layout and visual hierarchy. While the text alignment in the lower sections (category buttons, 'DETAILS' text, and 'Continue' button) appears correct, the error in the most prominent part of the UI is significant and justifies a low score. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | The border styling, specifically the border-radius of all elements, is a perfect match. The main content card, the category buttons, the image containers, and the 'Continue' button all have their respective corner radii replicated with complete accuracy. There are no visible borders (in terms of lines), and this is also consistent between the source and the recreation. |
| Iconography & Assets | 10 | 10 | All icons and image assets in the recreation are a perfect match to the source design. The style (e.g., outlined vs. filled), weight, and size of each icon (back arrow, share, heart, star, and continue arrow) are correctly implemented. The images used are also identical to the source. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 2 | 10 | The recreation is missing the most prominent shadow, which should be on the main content card, making it appear flat against the background image. The other shadows on the rating badge and the two smaller image cards are present but are significantly weaker and less diffuse than in the source design. This results in a loss of the intended depth and elevation. |
| Gradient/Fills | 7 | 10 | While most solid color fills on the buttons and the main background card are accurately replicated, the gradient overlay on the main hero image is not. The source image features a more prominent dark gradient behind the 'BALI' title to enhance text contrast and readability against the background. This gradient is much weaker or almost absent in the recreation, making the title harder to read. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 10 | 20 | There is a major discrepancy in the placement of the text elements in the main header. In the source design, the vertical order is the title 'BALI', the subtitle 'indonesia', and then the '4.9' rating. In the recreation, the '4.9' rating has been incorrectly moved above the 'BALI' title, changing the entire layout and hierarchy of this section. While other text elements on the page are placed correctly, this error in the primary header is significant. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation. This includes the time, location title and subtitle, rating, category tabs, image overlay text, details header, description text, and the continue button text. No text is missing or has been added. |
| Label Hierarchy | 3 | 10 | The visual hierarchy of the labels in the header section is not preserved. In the source image, 'BALI' is the clear primary heading, being large and bold, with 'indonesia' as a smaller, lighter subheading. In the recreation, this hierarchy is inverted; 'BALI' has a smaller font size and lighter weight, while 'indonesia' is larger and bolder, making the subheading incorrectly appear more prominent than the main heading. Additionally, the rating pill has been moved above the heading, disrupting the original top-down information flow. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures, specifically the category filter buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') and the two image cards below them, are perfectly replicated. The uniformity in size, spacing, alignment, and styling for both sets of repeated items is an exact match to the source design. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | The section titles and visual dividers in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. The main content card is positioned correctly, and the 'DETAILS' section label is placed with the correct alignment and spacing relative to the other elements on the screen. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The user interface in the source image does not contain any placeholder text elements (e.g., in a search bar or input field). Therefore, this criterion is not applicable, and no errors can be identified in the recreation. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source's handling of overflow. The text in the 'DETAILS' section is correctly truncated with an ellipsis and a 'Read More' link, and the image gallery correctly uses a '10+' overlay to indicate there are more images, both matching the source design exactly. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly replicates all visual feedback elements present in the source design. This includes the styling for selected and unselected states of the category buttons (e.g., 'Hotels' is selected) and the appearance of other interactive elements like the 'Read More' link and the 'Continue' button. As there are no discrepancies in the provided feedback regions, the recreation earns a perfect score. |
