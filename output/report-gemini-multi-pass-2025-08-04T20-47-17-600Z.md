### Detailed Breakdown
#### Text & Typography
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation. There are no missing or hallucinated text elements, resulting in a perfect match. |
| Text Content Accuracy | 10 | 10 | All text content in the recreation, including headers, labels, and body text, is an exact match to the source design. No discrepancies were found. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font family used in the recreation is a perfect match to the source. Key character shapes, such as the double-story 'a' and the open-loop 'g', are consistent across all text elements, indicating the correct font family was used. |
| Font Size | 6 | 10 | The font size for the 'Search' button text is smaller in the recreation. Additionally, the main description paragraph under 'DETAILS' and the 'Read More' link use a noticeably smaller font size compared to the source design. |
| Font Weight | 10 | 10 | All font weights in the recreation perfectly match the source. This includes the bold heading, regular body text, and the bold "Read More" link. No discrepancies were identified. |
| Line Height & Letter Spacing | 7 | 10 | The line height in the main description paragraph under "DETAILS" is smaller in the recreation. This makes the lines of text appear more compressed and closer together compared to the more spacious and readable layout in the source design. |
| Text Alignment | 10 | 10 | All text elements, including the header, input fields, buttons, and description blocks, correctly match the source image's text alignment. No alignment discrepancies were found. |

#### Color & Fill
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Background Color | 4 | 10 | The main UI background, bottom navigation bar, and the 'Search' button all use an incorrect, desaturated blue-grey color. The source uses a darker grey-blue for the background and a vibrant teal for the 'Search' button, which are key elements of the color scheme. |
| Text Color | 10 | 10 | All text colors, including headings, body copy, placeholder text, and text within buttons, perfectly match the source image. No discrepancies in color or opacity were found for any text element. |
| Accent & Icon Color | 4 | 10 | The primary accent color is incorrect. The 'Search' button is a muted blue-grey instead of bright teal. Additionally, the active 'Home' icon in the navigation bar is yellow, but it should be the teal accent color on a yellow background. |
| Gradient/Fills | 7 | 10 | The fill color of the "Search" button is incorrect. The source image uses a vibrant teal, whereas the recreation uses a muted, darker blue-grey. The other gradients on the page, such as the background and the "Save 50%" banner, are accurate. |

#### Sizing & Dimension
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Width Consistency | 6 | 10 | The 'Search' button is significantly narrower in the recreation compared to the source. In the source design, the button's width is nearly identical to the input fields above it, whereas the recreation's button is much shorter. |
| Element Height Consistency | 8 | 10 | The height of the 'Search' button is noticeably shorter in the recreation compared to the source. The vertical padding has been reduced, making the button appear less prominent than intended in the original design. |
| Icon/Asset Size | 8 | 10 | The home icon in the bottom navigation bar is significantly smaller in the recreation. In the source, the house icon fills more of its circular background, whereas in the recreation, it appears shrunken, leaving too much empty space. |
| Border Width | 10 | 10 | No discrepancies were found. The border widths on all elements, including the main card, bottom navigation bar, and notification icon, accurately match the source image. |

#### Spacing & Positioning
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element X-Axis Alignment | 10 | 10 | There are no discrepancies in horizontal alignment. All elements, from the header text and icons to the centered buttons and left-aligned content blocks, perfectly match the x-axis positioning of the source design. The alignment is identical. |
| Element Y-Axis Alignment | 10 | 10 | The vertical alignment of all components is a perfect match to the source. Text and icons within fields, buttons, and the navigation bar are all correctly centered on the Y-axis. No misalignments were detected. |
| Relative Ordering | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct visual order. For example, icons are correctly positioned before their corresponding text labels, and titles are correctly placed above their descriptive content, matching the source design perfectly. |
| Inner Padding | 10 | 10 | The inner padding for all components, including the input fields, the search button, the main content card, and the bottom navigation bar icons, is a perfect match to the source image. |
| Inter-Component Horizontal Spacing | 10 | 10 | There are no discernible differences in horizontal spacing. The margins between icons and text within input fields, between the greeting and the notification bell, and among the bottom navigation icons are all accurately replicated. |
| Inter-Component Vertical Spacing | 10 | 10 | The vertical spacing between all major components—the header, search form inputs, search button, content card, and bottom navigation—is a perfect match to the source design. No discrepancies were found. |

#### Structure & Hierarchy
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Group Nesting | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly replicates the nesting and structure of all visual groups. The search form, content card, and navigation bar elements are grouped identically to the source design, showing no discrepancies. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering of all elements is a perfect match. The content card, 'Save 50%' banner, and the floating navigation bar with its central button are all stacked correctly, just as they appear in the source image. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the single-column vertical layout. The grid structure, alignment, and spacing of all components and their internal elements are identical to the source design. No discrepancies were found. |
| Label Hierarchy | 9 | 10 | The visual hierarchy is mostly preserved. However, the body text under the "DETAILS" heading has a lighter font weight in the recreation compared to the source. The "DETAILS" heading itself also appears slightly less bold, which subtly alters the overall visual weight of the text block. |
| Repeated Content Uniformity | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly maintains the visual uniformity of the repeated input fields. The structure, internal alignment, and vertical spacing between the 'Location', 'Date', and 'Guests' sections are consistent and accurately match the source design. |
| Section Dividers/Separators | 10 | 10 | All visual separators, including the vertical line in the guest counter and the cards that divide the main sections, are present and correctly placed. The 'DETAILS' section label is also positioned accurately. |
| Placeholder & Fallback Content | 10 | 10 | The placeholder text within the input fields, such as "Location" and "2 Guests", is present and styled identically to the source image. The font weight, color, and content are a perfect match, with no discernible differences. |
| Overflow & Clipping | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly handles content overflow. The text clipping in the 'DETAILS' section, indicated by the ellipsis and 'Read More' link, is identical to the source. The image carousel also correctly clips the image within its rounded container, matching the source design. |

#### Styling & Effects
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Border Color | 10 | 10 | All border colors are accurately replicated. This includes the borders on the input fields, the notification icon, the main card, and the vertical divider in the 'Guests' input. No discrepancies were found. |
| Border Radius | 9 | 10 | The border radius for the selected 'Home' icon's background is slightly larger in the recreation. This makes the shape appear more circular compared to the more rectangular, rounded-corner shape in the source design. |
| Iconography Match | 9 | 10 | The iconography is nearly a perfect match. The only discrepancy is the color of the filled 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar; it is yellow in the recreation but white in the source design. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 4 | 10 | The recreation is missing key shadows on the main content card and the three input fields (Location, Date, Guests). The shadow on the "Search" button is also significantly less pronounced, making these components appear flat compared to the elevated look in the source design. |
