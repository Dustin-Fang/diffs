### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 15 | 15 | The alignment of all components in the recreation is a perfect match to the source design. The vertical alignment of the header elements, the icons and text within the input fields, and the icons in the bottom navigation bar are all correctly implemented. The horizontal alignment and distribution of elements across the entire screen also precisely match the source. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | All elements are placed in the correct order and grouped identically to the source image. For instance, icons consistently precede text in the input fields, the header elements are in the correct sequence, and the bottom navigation icons maintain their original order. The overall vertical layout flow is also a perfect match. |
| Element Size Consistency | 8 | 10 | The recreation is very close, but there are minor inconsistencies in the dimensions of key interactive elements. The 'Search' button in the recreation is noticeably shorter in height compared to the source design. Additionally, the central Floating Action Button (+) in the bottom navigation bar is smaller in diameter in the recreation. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly replicates the group nesting and hierarchy of the source design. All major visual groups, including the header, the search form block, the main content card, and the navigation bar, are correctly structured and spaced. Within these groups, sub-elements like the title and description within the card, and the icons within the input fields, are nested accurately, preserving the intended visual hierarchy. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | All overlapping elements in the recreation are correctly stacked, matching the source image perfectly. This includes the 'Save 50%' banner layered on top of the image, the central '+' button overlapping the bottom navigation bar, and the highlighted home icon's background sitting on top of the navigation bar. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the column and grid structure of the source design. The overall layout is a single column, which is correctly implemented. The multi-column structures within individual components, such as the input fields (e.g., icon/text on the left, another icon on the right) and the guest counter (icon/text, minus button, plus button), are all accurately replicated. The five-column structure of the bottom navigation bar is also maintained perfectly. There are no deviations in the grid layout. |
| Padding Within Components | 8 | 10 | The internal padding for most components is highly accurate. However, the primary 'Search' button shows a noticeable difference. In the recreation, the vertical padding above and below the 'Search' text is smaller than in the source image, making the button appear vertically compressed. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 10 | 15 | There are several noticeable discrepancies in the vertical spacing between major components. Specifically, the vertical margins between the three input fields ('Location', 'Date', 'Guests') are visibly larger in the recreation than in the source. Additionally, the space between the 'Search' button and the main content card below it is also significantly larger in the recreation, pushing the card further down the screen. These inconsistencies alter the overall vertical rhythm and component grouping of the layout when compared to the source design. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 12 | 20 | While most colors are correctly matched, including the main background, card backgrounds, and all text colors, there are two significant errors in key accent colors. The primary 'Search' button is a muted blue-grey in the recreation, instead of the vibrant teal from the source design. Additionally, the active 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation is orange/yellow, while in the source it uses the dark navy background color for the icon fill. |
| Button States | 3 | 10 | The recreation fails to accurately represent key button states from the source design. The primary 'Search' button's color is a muted blue-grey instead of the vibrant teal from the source, making it appear disabled rather than active. Additionally, the selected 'Home' button in the bottom navigation bar uses a duller, less saturated orange compared to the bright, saturated yellow-orange in the source image. These changes significantly alter the visual hierarchy and intended state of the interactive elements. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | The font family used in the recreation is a perfect match to the source image. A close comparison of all text elements, including headings, labels, body text, and button text, shows that the same sans-serif typeface has been used consistently across the entire UI. |
| Font Size & Weight | 8 | 10 | Most font sizes and weights are matched well. However, the placeholder text 'Location' and the main description paragraph under 'DETAILS' both appear to have a slightly lighter font weight in the recreation compared to the source image, making them less prominent. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 10 | 10 | The text alignment and spacing in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. The main heading is correctly centered. The text within the input fields, the 'DETAILS' heading, and the body paragraph are all correctly left-aligned. The line height in the multi-line description text is also consistent with the source. No discrepancies were found. |
| Border Styling | 6 | 10 | The corner radii are generally replicated well across the design. However, there are several inaccuracies in border color and visibility. The border on the notification icon is much darker and more prominent in the recreation. Similarly, the borders on the input fields (Location, Date, Guests) are darker than the subtle grey in the source. A key missing detail is the faint, semi-transparent white border around the 'Details' card, which is not present in the recreation. |
| Iconography & Assets | 9 | 10 | The iconography and assets are almost perfectly replicated. The style (outlined vs. filled), stroke weight, and size of the icons in the search form, top bar, and navigation bar are a very close match to the source. The main image asset is also correct. The only discrepancy is with the active 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar; the source uses a blue circular background for the active state, whereas the recreation uses a yellow/orange one. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 9 | 10 | The recreation successfully implements shadow and elevation effects on all the correct elements, including the notification bell, search inputs, search button, main content card, and bottom navigation bar. The shadows are generally well-matched in terms of direction and blur. However, there are minor discrepancies: the shadow on the 'Search' button is slightly less intense than the source, and the shadow on the bottom navigation bar is a bit less diffuse and soft compared to the original design. These are subtle differences in an otherwise excellent implementation. |
| Gradient/Fills | 4 | 10 | The recreation correctly preserves the gradient on the 'Save 50%' banner and the solid fill color on the active 'Home' navigation icon. However, there are significant discrepancies. The most notable is the 'Search' button, which has a muted blue-grey fill instead of the vibrant teal fill in the source design. Additionally, the main background gradient, while present, uses a different color palette; it's a neutral grey in the recreation versus a blue-grey in the source. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 15 | 20 | While most text placements are generally correct, several minor but distinct discrepancies prevent a perfect score. The main greeting "Hello, Sourany!" is positioned slightly higher relative to the avatar compared to the source. The text within the three input fields ("Location", "July 08 - July 15", "2 Guests") has a noticeably larger horizontal gap separating it from its respective icon. Finally, the "DETAILS" title is placed with too much vertical space below the image card, which in turn shifts the subsequent paragraph of text further down than in the source design. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation, with no missing or hallucinated text. The content of each text element is identical to the source. |
| Label Hierarchy | 7 | 10 | The overall label hierarchy is mostly preserved, but there are noticeable discrepancies in font weight. The 'DETAILS' heading in the recreation appears slightly less bold than in the source. More significantly, the text 'Search' on the primary call-to-action button is not bold in the recreation, whereas it is bold in the source, which diminishes its visual prominence and alters the intended hierarchy. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The recreation flawlessly replicates the repeated content structures. The list of search input fields ("Location," "Date," and "Guests") exhibits perfect visual uniformity. Each item has the same height, corner radius, and internal element alignment. The vertical spacing between these list items is consistent, precisely matching the source design. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | All section titles and dividers are perfectly replicated. The 'DETAILS' title is correctly positioned. The card acting as a divider for the search section and the main content section is placed correctly. The vertical divider in the 'Guests' input is also in the right spot. There are no discrepancies in the placement or alignment of these elements. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The styling (font, color, size) and positioning of the placeholder text and input values ('Location', 'July 08 - July 15', '2 Guests') are a perfect match to the source design. There are no discernible differences. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly implements all overflow and clipping behaviors seen in the source design. The main content's scroll position, the truncation of the "Details" text block with an ellipsis, and the clipping of the "Save 50%" banner by the parent card's rounded corners are all identical to the source. The implementation looks natural and perfectly adheres to the design constraints. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 6 | 15 | The recreation correctly implements some feedback elements, such as the notification dot on the bell icon and the 'Save 50%' promotional tag on the image. However, there are significant discrepancies in the colors used for other key feedback and active state elements. The active 'Home' icon in the bottom navigation bar is a dull orange on an off-white background in the recreation, whereas the source uses a vibrant teal icon on a pure white background. Additionally, the primary 'Search' button has been changed from the same vibrant teal to a muted, desaturated blue. This inconsistency in the color system for active states and primary actions means the visual feedback is not aligned with the expectations set by the source design. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 12 | 15 | Most elements are correctly aligned, such as the main 'BALI' title, the rating, the 'Continue' button (all horizontally centered), and the category tabs ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') which are well-distributed and vertically aligned. However, there is a clear alignment error in the 'Details' section. In the source, the 'Read More' link is aligned to the end of the last line of the paragraph text. In the recreation, this link has wrapped to a new line and is left-aligned, breaking the intended inline alignment. |
| Relative Positioning | 10 | 10 | All elements in the recreation are placed in the correct order and grouped identically to the source image. The sequence of header icons, text elements, category tabs, image gallery, details section, and the 'Continue' button with its internal text and icon order are all a perfect match. |
| Element Size Consistency | 10 | 10 | The recreation is a pixel-perfect match to the source design regarding element dimensions. A thorough comparison reveals that all components maintain their intended size. The header icons, the rating pill, the category buttons, the two image cards, and the 'Continue' button all have the exact same height and width as specified in the source design. There are no discrepancies in element sizing. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly replicates the nesting and hierarchical structure of all visual groups from the source image. Key groups, such as the header (title, subtitle, rating), the filter tabs, the image gallery, and the 'DETAILS' section (heading and body text), are all structured and positioned identically. The parent-child relationships between elements are perfectly preserved, resulting in a flawless match. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering of elements in the recreation is a perfect match to the source design. The main content card correctly overlaps the hero image, and all header elements (status bar, icons, title) are correctly stacked on top of the hero image, just as in the source. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves the column and grid structure of the source image. The three-button row at the top is correctly implemented as a single-row grid with even spacing. The two-column grid for the images is also perfectly replicated, maintaining the correct gutter size and alignment. The single-column structure for the 'Details' section and the 'Continue' button is also accurate. There are no deviations in the layout structure. |
| Padding Within Components | 9 | 10 | The padding within most components is recreated with high accuracy, particularly in the rating pill button and the main 'Continue' button. However, there is a very minor discrepancy in the category filter buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'). In the recreation, the text within these buttons is positioned slightly lower than in the source, resulting in a small imbalance between the top and bottom padding. The top padding is slightly larger than the bottom padding, whereas in the source, they are perfectly centered. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 12 | 15 | The inter-component spacing is mostly accurate, especially for the horizontal gaps between the category buttons and the gallery images. However, there are noticeable discrepancies in the vertical spacing in the lower half of the card. The margin between the description text and the 'Continue' button is significantly smaller in the recreation than in the source. Similarly, the margin between the 'Continue' button and the bottom edge of the card is also smaller, making the entire bottom section feel more compressed than intended. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | The recreation is a pixel-perfect match in terms of color. All background colors (main card, tabs), text colors (headings, body copy, buttons), and accent colors (the 'Continue' button, the rating star) are identical to the source image. The opacity levels, particularly on the semi-transparent rating element over the main image, are also accurately replicated. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The visible button states in the recreation are a perfect match to the source design. The 'selected' state of the 'Hotels' button, characterized by its dark background and white text, is implemented precisely. Similarly, the 'unselected' states of the 'Foods' and 'Activities' buttons, with their white backgrounds and dark text, are also an exact match. The styling of the 'Continue' button is also identical. |
| Typography Family | 10 | 10 | A thorough comparison of all text elements, including the main heading 'BALI', the subheading 'indonesia', the button labels, and the body text, confirms that the recreation uses the exact same font family as the source design. There are no visible differences in the typeface across the entire UI. |
| Font Size & Weight | 8 | 10 | The font sizes are very accurately replicated across the entire design. However, there are minor but noticeable discrepancies in font weight. The text for the tabs ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), the 'Read More' link, and the 'Continue' button all appear slightly less bold in the recreation compared to the source design. These subtle differences in weight slightly alter the visual hierarchy. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 10 | 10 | All text elements in the recreation are perfectly aligned according to the source image. The main titles ('BALI', 'indonesia') and rating are correctly center-aligned. The 'DETAILS' header and the subsequent paragraph are correctly left-aligned. The line height within the paragraph text is consistent and matches the source precisely. All other text elements, including those in buttons and the header, also match the source's alignment and spacing. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | The border styling in the recreation is a perfect match to the source. All elements, including the main content card, the category filter buttons, the image cards, and the 'Continue' button, have the correct border-radius applied, resulting in shapes that are identical to the source design. |
| Iconography & Assets | 10 | 10 | All icons and image assets in the recreation are a perfect match to the source design. The style (outlined top navigation icons, filled star icon), size, and specific assets used are all identical, resulting in a flawless replication for this category. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 5 | 10 | The recreation correctly applies a drop shadow to the main content card, matching the source's primary elevation effect. However, there are several inaccuracies in other elements. The shadows on the two smaller image cards and the 'Continue' button are noticeably darker and harsher than the very soft, subtle shadows in the source. Additionally, the filter buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') are flat in the recreation, missing the subtle inset shadow effect that provides a sense of depth in the original design. |
| Gradient/Fills | 10 | 10 | The gradient on the 'Continue' button is a perfect match to the source image, with the same colors and horizontal direction. The subtle dark gradient overlay at the top of the main image, which enhances the visibility of the status bar icons, is also correctly preserved. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 17 | 20 | While most text elements are placed with a high degree of accuracy, there are minor but noticeable vertical placement discrepancies. The main 'BALI' title and the 'indonesia' subtitle are positioned slightly lower than in the source design. Similarly, the 'DETAILS' heading and the description text block below it are also shifted downwards, creating a larger vertical space between the image gallery and the text content than is present in the source. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source design are present in the recreation. This includes the status bar time, location, ratings, category tabs, details heading, description, 'Read More' link, and the 'Continue' button text. No text is missing or hallucinated. |
| Label Hierarchy | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly preserves the visual label hierarchy from the source design. The main heading ('BALI') is the most prominent, followed by the subheading ('indonesia'). The 'DETAILS' section header is correctly styled in all-caps and a heavier weight than the subsequent body text, clearly defining the information architecture. The body text and the emphasized 'Read More' link also match the source's hierarchy. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures in the design, specifically the category filter buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') and the two image cards, are perfectly uniform and match the source. They exhibit consistent sizing, spacing, corner radii, and internal alignment, indicating a flawless recreation of these repeated elements. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | The placement of all section titles and dividers is a perfect match. The 'DETAILS' title is correctly positioned below the image cards and aligned to the left. The category tabs ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') are correctly centered and spaced from the top of the content card. The main white content card, acting as the primary visual divider, is also positioned identically to the source. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The source design does not contain any input fields with placeholder text. The recreation accurately reflects this by also not including any such elements. Therefore, it is a perfect match. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source design's overflow handling. The text in the "DETAILS" section is correctly truncated with an ellipsis and a "Read More" link, just like the source. Additionally, the horizontal image gallery correctly shows a portion of the next item, indicating that the area is scrollable. There are no deviations from the source in how overflow is managed. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 15 | 15 | The visual feedback for the selected tab ('Hotels') is perfectly replicated. The active state is clearly communicated with a filled, darker background and bold text, which is identical to the source design. The inactive states for 'Foods' and 'Activities' also match perfectly, using a lighter background and regular font weight. There are no discrepancies in how visual feedback is presented on the screen. |

### Detailed Breakdown
#### Layout & Structure
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Element Alignment | 10 | 15 | The overall alignment is mostly correct, especially within the main content card. However, there is a significant alignment discrepancy in the hero section. In the source image, the '4.9' rating badge is left-aligned with the 'BALI' and 'indonesia' text block below it, creating a single, clean vertical line. In the recreation, the rating badge has been shifted up and to the left, and the text block has been shifted down, breaking this crucial alignment and disrupting the visual grouping. |
| Relative Positioning | 7 | 10 | While the overall layout and grouping of most elements are correct, there is a notable discrepancy in the relative positioning of the elements in the header section over the main image. In the source design, the destination title 'BALI' is placed above the rating chip ('4.9 ★'). In the recreation, this order is swapped, with the rating chip appearing above the 'BALI' title. This changes the intended visual hierarchy of that key section. |
| Element Size Consistency | 5 | 10 | While many elements like the category pills and the two image cards match the source design's dimensions, there are several key inconsistencies in sizing. The main title 'BALI' is noticeably larger in the recreation, while the 'Indonesia' subtitle below it is smaller. The '4.9' star rating pill is also significantly smaller than in the source. Finally, the 'Continue' button at the bottom appears slightly smaller in both height and width. These deviations in text and component sizes alter the visual hierarchy and proportions from the original design. |
| Group Nesting & Hierarchy | 12 | 15 | The recreation correctly nests and structures most of the visual groups, such as the tab buttons, the image gallery, and the 'Details' section. However, there is a significant error in the hierarchy of the main header group overlaid on the image. In the source, the group is structured with the main title ('BALI') at the top, followed by the subtitle ('indonesia'), and then the rating pill. The recreation incorrectly places the rating pill at the very top of this group, disrupting the intended visual hierarchy where the location name is the most prominent element. |
| Z-Index / Layering | 10 | 10 | The layering and z-index of all elements in the recreation are a perfect match to the source design. The main content card correctly overlaps the background image, and all subsequent elements like buttons, text, and image overlays are stacked in the correct order. |
| Column/Grid Structure | 15 | 15 | The recreation perfectly preserves all column and grid structures from the source. The three-button horizontal layout is accurately replicated, as is the two-column grid for the images below it. Spacing, gaps, and alignment within these structures and relative to the parent container are all consistent with the source design. |
| Padding Within Components | 10 | 10 | The internal padding for all components is a perfect match. The text and icons within the rating pill, the category filter buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), the image overlay text ('10+'), and the 'Continue' button all have the correct vertical and horizontal padding, mirroring the source design exactly. |
| Inter-Component Spacing | 7 | 15 | While the vertical spacing between the category buttons, the image gallery, and the 'DETAILS' header is accurately replicated, there are several significant discrepancies in other areas. The spacing between the hero image section and the main content card is incorrect due to the misplacement of the rating badge. Furthermore, the space between the 'DETAILS' header and the description text is slightly too large, and the space between the description text and the 'Continue' button is significantly smaller than in the source design, creating a cramped feel at the bottom of the card. |

#### Visual Design
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Color Matching | 20 | 20 | A thorough comparison using a color picker tool reveals that all colors in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. This includes the background colors of the main card and various buttons, all text colors across the interface, accent colors like the yellow star and teal button, and the opacity of elements like the rating badge and image overlays. There are no discernible differences in color values. |
| Button States | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly captures the visual distinction between button states as shown in the source design. The 'Hotels' button is correctly shown in a 'selected' state with a light grey background and darker text, while the 'Foods' and 'Activities' buttons are correctly shown in their default, unselected state with a white background and lighter text. All states are visually identical to the source. |
| Typography Family | 7 | 10 | The recreation correctly identifies and uses the primary font family for most of the UI elements, such as the body text, buttons, and category tabs. However, it fails to use the distinct display font family intended for the main headline "BALI". The source image uses a wider font with a flat-topped 'A' for "BALI", while the recreation uses the same font family as the rest of the interface, which features a pointed 'A'. |
| Font Size & Weight | 4 | 10 | The recreation fails to match the font size and weight of key elements. Most notably, the main heading 'BALI' is significantly smaller and has a much lighter font weight compared to the source design. Additionally, the font weight for the category buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), the '10+' text, the 'Read More' link, and the 'Continue' button text is consistently lighter than in the source. These discrepancies alter the visual hierarchy and emphasis of the original design. |
| Text Alignment & Spacing | 4 | 10 | There is a major discrepancy in text alignment within the hero section. In the source image, the main title "BALI", the subtitle "indonesia", and the rating "4.9 ★" are all center-aligned horizontally on the screen. In the recreation, these elements have been incorrectly changed to be left-aligned, which fundamentally alters the design's intended layout and visual balance. |
| Border Styling | 10 | 10 | The border styling in the recreation is a perfect match to the source. All elements, including the main content card, the category selection buttons, the image containers, and the 'Continue' button, have the correct border-radius applied. Neither design uses visible border strokes, and the recreation accurately reflects this. |
| Iconography & Assets | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly matches the source design in terms of iconography and assets. All icons, including the back arrow, share, and heart icons, have the correct outlined style and weight. The filled star icon is also accurately reproduced. The image assets used for the main background and the gallery are identical to the source. |
| Shadow & Elevation | 4 | 10 | The recreation attempts to add shadows to elevated elements, but the execution differs significantly from the source. The most prominent issue is the complete absence of a drop shadow on the '4.9 ★' rating pill, making it appear flat against the background image, whereas it is clearly elevated in the source. Additionally, the shadows on the main content card, the two smaller image cards, and the 'Continue' button are all present but are noticeably darker, sharper, and less diffuse than the soft, subtle shadows in the source design. |
| Gradient/Fills | 7 | 10 | The recreation correctly implements the solid color fills for the buttons and backgrounds. However, the gradients are not perfectly matched. The primary gradient overlay at the top of the hero image is present but appears stronger and extends further down than in the source. Additionally, the subtle gradient on the '10+' image overlay in the source has been replaced with a solid translucent fill in the recreation. |

#### Content & Information Architecture
| Subcategory | Score | Max Points | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text Placement | 12 | 20 | While most text elements like the category tabs, the 'DETAILS' section, and the 'Continue' button text are placed correctly, there is a major discrepancy in the header section. In the source image, the vertical order is 'BALI', then 'indonesia', and finally the '4.9 ★' rating badge below them. In the recreation, this order is incorrectly changed to have the rating badge at the very top, followed by 'BALI' and 'indonesia', fundamentally altering the intended text placement and visual hierarchy. |
| Text Content Presence | 10 | 10 | All text elements from the source image are present in the recreation. This includes the time in the status bar, the main heading and subheading ('BALI', 'indonesia'), the rating ('4.9'), the category buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities'), the image overlay ('10+'), the 'DETAILS' heading, the description paragraph, and the 'Continue' button text. No text is missing, and no extra text has been hallucinated. |
| Label Hierarchy | 6 | 10 | While the label hierarchy within the 'DETAILS' section (heading, body text, and emphasized 'Read More') is correctly preserved, the hierarchy of the main title block is not. In the source image, the visual hierarchy is clearly the location 'BALI' as the primary heading, followed by the subheading 'indonesia', and then the '4.9' rating. The recreation inverts this by placing the rating element above the main 'BALI' heading, which fundamentally changes the visual reading order and fails to preserve the original label hierarchy. |
| Repeated Content Structures | 15 | 15 | The repeated content structures, specifically the category filter buttons ('Hotels', 'Foods', 'Activities') and the image gallery cards, are perfectly replicated. Both sets of elements maintain consistent size, spacing, corner radii, and styling, matching the source design exactly. The uniformity and visual correctness of these repeated items are flawless. |
| Section Titles/Dividers | 10 | 10 | All section labels and visual dividers in the recreation are a perfect match to the source image. The main content card, the category selection pills, the image cards, the 'DETAILS' title, and the 'Continue' button are all positioned correctly with accurate spacing and alignment. |
| Placeholder/Text Fallbacks | 10 | 10 | The source design does not contain any placeholder text elements (such as a search bar). The recreation correctly reflects this absence. Therefore, based on the provided criteria, the recreation is a perfect match. |
| Overflow Handling | 10 | 10 | The recreation perfectly replicates the source's method for handling text overflow. The text in the 'DETAILS' section is correctly truncated with an ellipsis and followed by a 'Read More' link, exactly matching the design and providing a natural user experience. |
| Visual Feedback Regions | 12 | 15 | The recreation accurately implements most visual feedback elements. The active state for the selected "Hotels" button and the "10+" overlay on the gallery image are perfect matches to the source. However, there is a significant discrepancy in the placement of the rating element. In the source design, the "4.9" rating is located below the main "BALI" title, but in the recreation, it has been incorrectly moved to a position above the title. This misplacement affects the overall visual alignment of this key feedback region. |
