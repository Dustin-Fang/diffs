<td>10</td>
<td>The &quot;Hello, Sourany!&quot; text alignment differs slightly. In the source, it is centered in the space between the profile picture and the notification icon. In the recreation, it appears to be centered relative to the screen width, shifting it slightly left compared to the source.</td>
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Inter-Component Vertical Spacing</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The vertical spacing between the search form fields and the &#39;Search&#39; button is slightly larger. The gap between the &#39;Search&#39; button and the main content card is also increased. Conversely, the space between the &#39;DETAILS&#39; heading and its description text is smaller.</td>

<td>The recreation is missing the horizontal line separators between the input fields (Location, Date, and Guests) within the top search card. The vertical separator in the &#39;Guests&#39; input and the main card-based separation are correctly implemented.</td>
</tr>

<td>Placeholder &amp; Fallback Content</td>
<td>6</td>

<td>The placeholder text in the input fields is present, but its styling is incorrect. The font weight in the recreation is noticeably lighter than the semi-bold weight used in the source design, making the text appear thinner and less prominent.</td>
</tr>
