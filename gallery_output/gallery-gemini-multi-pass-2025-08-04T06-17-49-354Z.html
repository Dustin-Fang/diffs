<td>A detailed analysis using a color picker confirms that all background, text, and accent colors are a perfect match to the source image. The colors of interactive elements, such as the buttons and rating star, are accurately replicated. Furthermore, the color and opacity of the gradients and overlays on the images are identical to the source.</td>

<td>The selected &#39;Hotels&#39; button in the recreation uses a solid background color, whereas the source design features a subtle vertical gradient. The unselected &#39;Foods&#39; and &#39;Activities&#39; buttons are also rendered with a flat color, missing the slight gradient present in the source. Similarly, the primary &#39;Continue&#39; button lacks the gradient effect seen in the source design, resulting in a flatter appearance.</td>

<td>The font used for the main heading &quot;BALI&quot; is a different, more condensed sans-serif than the wider font in the source. The font for the subheading &quot;indonesia&quot; is also incorrect, appearing as a much lighter weight in the recreation. While other text elements are similar, the primary display fonts that define the screen&#39;s typographic identity do not match.</td>

<td>The main heading &quot;BALI&quot; has a lighter font weight in the recreation compared to the bolder text in the source. The rating text &quot;4.9&quot; is significantly less bold in the recreation, reducing its visual prominence compared to the source. The text within the category buttons (&quot;Hotels&quot;, &quot;Foods&quot;, &quot;Activities&quot;) is lighter in the recreation than the semi-bold text in the source design.</td>

<td>The rating badge is missing the subtle drop shadow that makes it pop from the background image in the source. The two smaller image cards within the main content area are also missing their drop shadows, making them look flat. Similarly, the &quot;Continue&quot; button lacks the drop shadow seen in the original design, reducing its sense of elevation.</td>

<td>Gradient/Fills</td>

<td>10</td>
<td>The recreation is missing the prominent dark gradient overlay at the top of the main background image, which reduces the legibility of the status bar content. The gradient on the smaller image with the &quot;10+&quot; text is also slightly less intense and covers a smaller area in the recreation. Consequently, the overall visual hierarchy and contrast intended by the source design&#39;s gradients are not preserved.</td>

<td>The main heading &#39;BALI&#39; is incorrectly placed below the rating element, which disrupts the visual flow and diminishes its prominence. This reordering incorrectly elevates the rating&#39;s importance above the primary location name in the visual hierarchy. While the hierarchy of the &#39;DETAILS&#39; section and its body text is preserved, the change to the main heading is a significant deviation.</td>
