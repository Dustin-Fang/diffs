<td>The vertical padding within the top rating button is smaller in the recreation, making it appear less spacious. The category filter buttons also have reduced top and bottom padding, causing the text to be closer to the component&#39;s edges. Finally, the main &#39;Continue&#39; button exhibits less vertical padding, resulting in a shorter appearance compared to the source.</td>

<td>The vertical space between the category buttons and the image grid is larger in the recreation than in the source. The margin between the image grid and the &quot;DETAILS&quot; heading is smaller in the recreation. The vertical gap between the description text block and the &quot;Continue&quot; button is noticeably smaller in the recreation.</td>

The unselected states of the &#39;Foods&#39; and &#39;Activities&#39; buttons are also an exact match to the design. The primary &#39;Continue&#39; action button is perfectly replicated with no visual differences.</td>

<td>Typography Family</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The primary heading &#39;BALI&#39; in the source uses a wide, geometric sans-serif font, but the recreation uses a noticeably narrower and more condensed font family. The font used for the category buttons like &#39;Hotels&#39; is rounder and more spacious in the source image than in the recreation. This font discrepancy is also apparent in the &#39;DETAILS&#39; header and the body text, where the recreation&#39;s font has a more compact character structure.</td>

<tr>
<td>Font Size &amp; Weight</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The main heading &quot;BALI&quot; has a lighter font weight in the recreation compared to the bolder text in the source. The rating text &quot;4.9&quot; is significantly less bold in the recreation, reducing its visual prominence compared to the source. The text within the category buttons (&quot;Hotels&quot;, &quot;Foods&quot;, &quot;Activities&quot;) is lighter in the recreation than the semi-bold text in the source design.</td>

<td>The main title &quot;BALI&quot; is left-aligned in the recreation instead of being center-aligned as shown in the source. The subtitle &quot;indonesia&quot; is also incorrectly left-aligned, whereas it should be centered below the main title. The rating element is left-aligned in the recreation but is centered in the source design.</td>

<td>Border Styling</td>

<td>10</td>
<td>The border radius applied to all components, including the main container, buttons, and image cards, perfectly matches the source. The absence of a visible border stroke on all elements is also correctly replicated. There are no deviations in border styling between the recreation and the source.</td>

<td>Iconography &amp; Assets</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The back arrow icon in the recreation is filled, whereas the source uses a thin, outlined style. The star icon within the rating badge is noticeably smaller in the recreation than in the source. The share and heart icons in the top navigation bar appear to have a slightly heavier line weight in the recreation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shadow &amp; Elevation</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The rating badge is missing the subtle drop shadow that makes it pop from the background image in the source. The two smaller image cards within the main content area are also missing their drop shadows, making them look flat. Similarly, the &quot;Continue&quot; button lacks the drop shadow seen in the original design, reducing its sense of elevation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gradient/Fills</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The dark gradient overlay at the top of the main image, intended to enhance status bar legibility, is completely missing in the recreation. The gradient on the &quot;10+&quot; image is present but is noticeably less intense and covers a smaller area than in the source. The recreation fails to preserve the primary gradient fill from the source design.</td>

The subheading &#39;indonesia&#39; is left-aligned with the heading in the recreation, unlike the centered alignment in the source which created a different visual grouping.

The overflow handling for the image gallery, shown by the &#39;10+&#39; overlay, is also perfectly replicated. The overall clipping of content within the main card is natural and consistent, correctly implying a scrollable area.</td>

<td>The rating pill, a key feedback element, is incorrectly positioned above the main &quot;BALI&quot; title instead of below it. Consequently, the &quot;Indonesia&quot; subtitle is also misplaced below the main title, whereas it should be above it. This reordering of the rating, title, and subtitle elements fundamentally changes the visual hierarchy and information flow compared to the source design.</td>
