<td>15</td>
<td>The rating component is incorrectly positioned in the top-left corner instead of below the main title, altering its margins with the surrounding text. The vertical space between the &quot;indonesia&quot; subtitle and the main content card is significantly smaller than in the source. The main title block is positioned lower on the screen, which incorrectly changes the margin between it and the top header icons.</td>

<td>All visible button states, including the selected &#39;Hotels&#39; button, the unselected &#39;Foods&#39; and &#39;Activities&#39; buttons, and the primary &#39;Continue&#39; button, are a pixel-perfect match to the source design in terms of color, typography, and styling.</td>

<td>Typography Family</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The primary heading &#39;BALI&#39; uses a different font family; the source font is more geometric and wider, with a distinct flat-topped &#39;A&#39;, unlike the pointed &#39;A&#39; in the recreation. The font used for subheadings like &#39;indonesia&#39; and button text like &#39;Hotels&#39; is also incorrect, which is clearly visible in the different construction of the letter &#39;a&#39;. The body text for the &#39;DETAILS&#39; section also uses a different font family, resulting in a noticeable change in the overall typographic feel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Font Size &amp; Weight</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The main heading &#39;BALI&#39; is rendered in a lighter font weight in the recreation compared to the heavy weight used in the source. The text within the category buttons (&#39;Hotels&#39;, &#39;Foods&#39;, &#39;Activities&#39;) is also lighter in weight compared to the source design. Similarly, the &#39;DETAILS&#39; sub-heading and the &#39;Continue&#39; button text are less bold in the recreation.</td>

<td>3</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The main heading &quot;BALI&quot; and the subheading &quot;indonesia&quot; are left-aligned in the recreation, whereas they are center-aligned in the source design. The rating element is positioned at the top left in the recreation, while it is centered below the main heading in the source. The vertical spacing between the &quot;BALI&quot; heading and the &quot;indonesia&quot; subheading is significantly larger in the recreation.</td>

<td>Border Styling</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>There are no discrepancies in the border radius of the main content card or the contained image cards. The border styling for the pill-shaped buttons, including the inactive state&#39;s color and width, is also a perfect match. All elements with rounded corners have been replicated with no deviations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Iconography &amp; Assets</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The back arrow icon in the recreation is filled and thicker, whereas the source icon is a thin, outlined arrow. The share and heart icons in the top bar have a slightly heavier stroke weight in the recreation compared to the source. Additionally, the star icon within the rating pill is noticeably smaller in the recreation than in the source design.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shadow &amp; Elevation</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The rating pill is missing its drop shadow entirely in the recreation, whereas it is clearly present in the source. The main content card&#39;s shadow is darker and less spread out in the recreation compared to the softer, more diffuse shadow in the source. The shadows on the two image cards are also slightly less pronounced in the recreation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gradient/Fills</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The recreation perfectly preserves the subtle dark gradient at the top of the screen, which enhances the legibility of the status bar icons. The gradient overlay on the &#39;10+&#39; image thumbnail is also an exact match to the source design. All solid color fills for the buttons and the main content card are accurately replicated.</td>

The rating element has been moved from below the main heading to above it, changing the reading order of the header information. The font weight for the &#39;indonesia&#39; subheading appears slightly lighter in the recreation, which subtly alters its relationship with the main heading.</td>

The handling of the image gallery overflow, indicated by the &#39;10+&#39; overlay, is also identical to the source design. The overall clipping of the main content card implies the same natural scrollable area as the original.</td>

The background color of the selected &quot;Hotels&quot; button is a darker, more saturated purple compared to the lighter lavender in the source. The font weight for the &quot;10+&quot; text overlay on the image appears slightly bolder in the recreation.</td>
