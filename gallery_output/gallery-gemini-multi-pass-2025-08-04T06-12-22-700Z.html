<td>The vertical stacking order of the header elements is incorrect, with the rating element moved from below the &#39;BALI&#39; text to above it. The horizontal spacing between the three category buttons (&#39;Hotels&#39;, &#39;Foods&#39;, &#39;Activities&#39;) is narrower than in the source. Similarly, the gutter between the two images in the two-column grid is narrower in the recreation.</td>

<td>Padding Within Components</td>

<td>The horizontal padding within the rating tag is slightly different; the recreation has more symmetrical padding on the left and right of the content, whereas the source has slightly less padding on the right side of the star.</td>

<tr>
<td>Inter-Component Spacing</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>The &quot;4.9 star&quot; rating is incorrectly positioned above the &quot;BALI&quot; title instead of below it, altering its spacing with the title and the main content card. The vertical margin between the description paragraph and the &quot;Continue&quot; button is significantly larger in the recreation. There is also increased vertical space between the category buttons and the image grid below them.</td>

<td>The selected state of the &#39;Hotels&#39; button, with its darker background and white text, is perfectly replicated from the source design. The unselected states of the &#39;Foods&#39; and &#39;Activities&#39; buttons also precisely match the lighter background and dark text seen in the source. Therefore, the visual distinction between the different button states is flawlessly implemented.</td>

The font family for the body text and button labels like &#39;Hotels&#39; and &#39;Continue&#39; is also identical to the source image. There are no discernible differences in the typography family across any element in the UI.</td>

<td>The main heading &quot;BALI&quot; has a lighter font weight in the recreation compared to the heavier, bolder weight used in the source design. The subheading &quot;indonesia&quot; also appears to have a slightly lighter font weight in the recreation. Furthermore, the &quot;DETAILS&quot; label and the &quot;Read More&quot; link are not as bold in the recreation as they are in the source.</td>

<td>The main heading &#39;BALI&#39; and subheading &#39;indonesia&#39; are left-aligned in the recreation, whereas they are center-aligned in the source design. The rating element is also left-aligned in the recreation, deviating from its centered alignment in the source. The vertical spacing between the &#39;BALI&#39; heading and the &#39;indonesia&#39; subheading is noticeably larger in the recreation compared to the source.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shadow &amp; Elevation</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The drop shadow on the &#39;Continue&#39; button is significantly darker and harsher in the recreation compared to the soft, subtle shadow in the source. The category buttons for &#39;Hotels,&#39; &#39;Foods,&#39; and &#39;Activities&#39; are missing the subtle inner shadow effect present in the source, making them appear flat. The shadows on the top navigation icons and the rating badge are much more pronounced and less diffuse than the delicate shadows in the original design.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Gradient/Fills</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>10</td>
<td>The recreation is missing the dark gradient overlay at the top of the main background image, which reduces the contrast and legibility of the status bar elements. The source design includes this gradient to make the white text and icons stand out against the bright sky. While the gradient on the smaller &#39;10+&#39; image is present, the omission of the primary screen gradient is a significant deviation.</td>

Overall, all repeated content structures are visually correct and uniform with no discrepancies.</td>

<td>The text clipping in the details section, indicated by the &#39;Read More&#39; link, is perfectly replicated from the source. The overflow indicator in the image gallery, represented by the &#39;10+&#39; overlay, is also identical in appearance and placement. The overall implied scrollable area of the main content card looks natural and perfectly follows the design constraints shown in the source image.</td>

<td>Visual Feedback Regions</td>

<td>The rating pill, a key feedback element, is incorrectly positioned above the main &#39;BALI&#39; title instead of below it. This misplacement alters the intended visual hierarchy of the header section. As a result of the rating pill&#39;s new position, the &#39;BALI&#39; title and the &#39;indonesia&#39; subtitle are both shifted down.</td>
